1
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,480
I have today ordered to Vietnam the Airmobile Division

2
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,290
and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength

3
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,750
from 75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately.

4
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,540
This will make it necessary to increase our active fighting forces

5
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:23,600
by raising the monthly draft call from 17,000 to 35,000.

6
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,660
December 30th.

7
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:30,500
All those whose birthday falls on December 30th.

8
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:33,250
President Johnson announced new monthly draft totals

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:34,830
increasing to 35,000 per month.

10
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,790
‎-43,000 per month…   -51,000…

11
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:42,160
382,386 men between the ages of 18 and 24 have been called to duty.

12
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,080
Now it should be incandescently clear

13
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:50,330
that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today

14
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,620
can ignore the present war.

15
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,830
If America's soul becomes totally poisoned,

16
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,850
part of the autopsy must read, "Vietnam."

17
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,910
What we need in the United States is not hatred,

18
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,540
but is love and wisdom.

19
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,830
So I ask you tonight to return home,

20
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,980
to say a prayer for the family of Martin Luther King.

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,750
August 24th.

22
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,500
‎All those whose birthday falls…

23
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,910
Another 30,000 troops have been deployed to the region.

24
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,000
This, after the US saw its greatest increase in monthly casualties.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,700
What we saw were population centers.

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,350
Schoolhouses, pagodas, women and children.

27
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,950
And that's American napalm.

28
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:38,690
Women and children were burned alive. Tom?

29
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,580
The Democratic Party

30
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,730
is gonna end up nominating Hubert Humphrey next month in Chicago.

31
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:50,060
Now, when it comes to the war and social justice,

32
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:52,500
there is simply not enough of a difference

33
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,000
between Humphrey and Nixon to make a difference.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,910
And so, we're going to Chicago.

35
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,000
Young people, by busloads, will go to Chicago

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,410
to show our solidarity and our disgust.

37
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:05,000
‎But most importantly…

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,440
To get laid by someone you just met.

39
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:11,540
536,000 of us sent to a country

40
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,040
none of these bumper-sticker patriots in Washington could find on a map

41
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,850
with a motherfuckin' map!

42
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,950
We're goin' to Chicago.

43
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,500
Anyone who stays in the park, sings Woody Guthrie, they'll be fine.

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,910
But the cops are gonna be a half-inch from losin' their fuckin' minds,

45
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,560
'cause Daley's gonna wind 'em up to make sure of it.

46
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,870
We're goin' to Chicago peacefully. We're goin' peacefully.

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,250
But if we're met there with violence,

48
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,660
‎you better believe that we're gonna meet that violence with…

49
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:43,160
Nonviolence. Always nonviolence, and that's without exception.

50
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,620
-What if the police hit you?   -Why would the police hit me?

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,910
-What if they do?   -I'll duck.

52
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,950
David, he watches the news.

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:54,850
I've organized 100 protests. This one will be no different in that it almost certainly won't work.

54
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:57,080
-The police are--   -I'm not worried about them.

55
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,250
I'm worried about Hoffman and Rubin.

56
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,660
It's the Democratic National Convention, honey.

57
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,160
Every camera in America is gonna be pointed at it,

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,450
and Daley is not gonna let his city turn into a theater of war.

59
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,200
Hoffman and Rubin are geniuses in their own special way.

60
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,810
-Oh, dear God.   -He's got a Boy Scout meeting at 7:00.

61
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,250
-Dad, if the police--   -If the police try to arrest me,

62
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:19,850
I'll do what I always do and what I taught you to do, which is what?

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,950
‎Very calmly and very politely…

64
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,450
Fuck the motherfuckers up!

65
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,410
They leave us alone and everything's cool.

66
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,040
They tangle, disrupt, intimidate,

67
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,080
play fast and loose with the First Amendment,

68
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,580
start breaking heads, then we will not be on our way.

69
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,330
You can't give this speech in Chicago.

70
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,870
-Fred wants me there. Plane ticket.   -Let Fred give the speech.

71
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:40,160
Between Hayden and Hoffman, there could be 5,000 people.

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,700
Be nice to talk to 5,000 people.

73
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,580
Not while you're in trouble in Connecticut.

74
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,830
I'm the head of the Black Panthers, Sondra.

75
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,830
When won't I be in trouble? Travel bag.

76
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,950
You'll be in a lot more of it if you stand up and say, "Fry the pigs."

77
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,830
If they attack. Takin' it out of context.

78
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:56,250
So will every white person in America. Cops won't give a shit about context.

79
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,870
You don't have protection in Chicago.

80
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,500
There's no place to be but in it.

81
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
-But "fry the pigs"?   -If they attack--

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,040
-Dr. King--   -Is dead.

83
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,910
He has a dream? Now he has a fuckin' bullet in his head.

84
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:09,870
Martin's dead, Malcolm's dead, Medgar's dead, Bobby's dead, Jesus is dead.

85
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,410
They tried it peacefully, we gonna try something else.

86
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,600
Sondra, I'll be there for four hours. That's it.

87
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,940
Snack.

88
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,000
You'll at least take one of these?

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,150
If I knew how to use that, I wouldn't need to be making speeches.

90
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,620
It's named after the Russian commissar Vyacheslav Mikhailovich Molotov.

91
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,440
You start with a glass bottle.

92
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,480
‎You fill it up halfway with gasoline and motor oil…

93
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:47,900
You pack some Styrofoam, and now your cherry bomb.

94
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,100
‎Some chewing gum around the top…

95
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,040
‎…and a fuse.

96
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,270
Now!

97
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,160
The 35th National Democratic Convention is set to begin next week

98
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,700
with repeated assurances from Chicago Mayor, Richard J. Daley.

99
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,160
-Will it be a good convention, Mr. Mayor?   -The best ever held.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,000
-Is that Jerry?   -Yeah.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,830
Tell him to tell Abbie we're going to Chicago to end the war

102
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:17,400
and not to fuck around.

103
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,500
Tom says to tell Abbie that we're going to Chicago to end the war

104
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,150
and not to fuck around.

105
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,410
Hayden says we're goin' to Chicago to end the war and not to fuck around.

106
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:29,370
Tell Hayden I went to Brandeis and I can do both.

107
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,330
We're going to show that we, as a generation, are serious people.

108
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,910
People say, "Abbie, are you concerned about an overreaction from the cops?"

109
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,120
I issued a police order to shoot to kill any arsonists.

110
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,660
We're not concerned about it.

111
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,040
Four units of the Illinois National Guard, totaling 5,000 troops,

112
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,540
have been sent to Chicago.

113
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,790
We're countin' on it!

114
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,290
We wanna underscore again that we're coming to Chicago peacefully,

115
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:55,080
but whether we're given permits or not, we're coming.

116
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,700
‎An additional 10,000 Chicago police officers, including riot squads…

117
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
We're not going to storm the convention with tanks or mace,

118
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,700
but we are going to storm the hearts and minds of the American people.

119
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:07,040
These people are revolutionaries

120
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,450
bent on the destruction of the government of the United States of America.

121
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:15,750
The Democratic Convention is about to begin in a police state.

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,850
There just doesn't seem to be any other way to say it.

123
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,770
You've arrived at a moment in history.

124
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:45,810
Pardon?

125
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,020
They're changing the picture.

126
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,410
-Tom.   -Howard.

127
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,270
-Flew in all right?   -Sure.

128
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,040
-Richard Schultz?   -Yes, sir.

129
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,620
Howard Ackerman, Special Advisor to the Attorney General.

130
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,000
-Pleased to meet you.   -Anyone tell you what this is about?

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,790
No, sir. Just to meet Mr. Foran at O'Hare this morning, we'd fly to Washington.

132
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,100
-We'd be meeting Mr. Mitchell.   -Good.

133
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,730
Finally changing that goddamn picture. Come on in.

134
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,580
As a matter of courtesy and tradition,

135
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,200
when we elect a new president, the outgoing cabinet members resign

136
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,690
to spare the new president the unpleasantness of firing 'em.

137
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:31,120
Richard, do you know when President Nixon

138
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,400
received Ramsey Clark's formal letter of resignation?

139
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,200
-No, sir.   -About an hour before my confirmation.

140
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,870
That was to embarrass me.

141
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,330
I don't know, I think it was more embarrassing for Ramsey Clark.

142
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,330
I'm John Mitchell.

143
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,040
Thomas Foran, Mr. Attorney General, and this is Richard Schultz.

144
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,790
Richard, Chicago is more fucked up than any ten things I've ever seen in my life.

145
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,750
-Sir?   -The convention, the riots.

146
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,770
-Yes, sir.   -Sit.

147
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,910
-Johnnie Walker okay with everybody?   -Yes, thank you.

148
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,700
-Richard?   -Nothing for me, thank you.

149
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,080
We don't know how Humphrey's people could have been that stupid.

150
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,020
Allow their guy to be nominated under armed guard.

151
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,750
-Sir?   -Son, are you nervous?

152
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,810
-No, sir.   -Why the fuck not?

153
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,290
I'm kidding. Don't believe everything you've heard about me.

154
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:18,730
Ramsey Clark gave me the finger on the way out the door.

155
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm asking if you think Chicago was why Humphrey lost the election.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,580
No, sir. The Republicans ran a better candidate.

157
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,750
-That's for damn sure.   -Daley didn't help his party,

158
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,950
but Humphrey's people and Daley didn't break the law,

159
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,410
so that's somebody else's table.

160
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,000
As a matter of fact, we don't believe any federal laws were broken last summer.

161
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Mr. Foran had our office run a thorough investigation.

162
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,540
There was trespassing, destruction of public property, lewd behavior.

163
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,580
Nothing that would rise to the level--

164
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,290
You think you and your boss are in the attorney general's office

165
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:50,850
because I want you to seek an indictment for violating a federal trespassing law?

166
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,790
Our office wasn't aware that the Justice Department

167
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,500
wanted to seek any indictments at all.

168
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
-We do.   -Ramsey Clark was dead set against--

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,870
Ramsey Clark doesn't run the Justice Department anymore,

170
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:01,040
did you hear about that?

171
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,660
-And Mr. Johnson's back home in Texas.   -Of course, sir.

172
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:06,200
One hour before my confirmation hearing gaveled,

173
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,900
that's when he resigned. What a prick!

174
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,580
That's unprofessional.

175
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:13,750
Unprofessional? It was unpatriotic. I'll tell you what else.

176
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:17,330
It was impolite. There's such a thing as manners.

177
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:21,100
I want to bring back manners. How about that? The America I grew up in.

178
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,870
Will you help me, Mr. Schultz?

179
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:26,120
'Cause I asked Mr. Foran who was the best prosecutor in his office.

180
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,950
-He said you.   -Thank you.

181
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,950
Section 2101 of Title 18.

182
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,000
That's the federal law that was broken.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,700
That's the Rap Brown Law.

184
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:38,410
In conspiracy to cross state lines in order to incite violence.

185
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,540
Comes with a maximum of ten years. We want all ten.

186
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:44,060
-For whom, sir?   -The all-star team.

187
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:50,410
"Abbie Hoffman, Tom Hayden, Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis,

188
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:54,250
‎Lee Weiner, John Froines… and Bobby Seale?"

189
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:58,330
I call 'em the school boys, and when I do, everyone here knows who I'm talking about.

190
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,250
Petulant and dangerous.

191
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,910
And we watched for a decade while these rebels without a job,

192
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,620
who never got their hands dirty fighting the enemy,

193
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:09,440
tell us how to prosecute a war.

194
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,620
The decade's over, the grown-ups are back, and I deem these shitty little fairies

195
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,830
to be a threat to national security.

196
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,450
So they're gonna spend their thirties in a federal facility.

197
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:23,100
-Real-time.   -You're lead prosecutor, Richard.

198
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:25,750
You understand why I couldn't tell you until we got here?

199
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,910
Sure. Of course, sir.

200
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:31,480
Richard, you're being handed the ball. Are you ready for this?

201
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,310
You pay me for my opinion.

202
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,000
-What?   -I said, sir, you pay me for my opinion.

203
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,660
Where'd you learn that? In class? I pay you to win.

204
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,250
I'm not sure we can get a good indictment on conspiracy.

205
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,040
-Why not?   -Some of them have never met each other.

206
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,690
Telephones.

207
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,540
Mr. Attorney General, the Rap Brown Law was created by Southern whites in Congress

208
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,000
to limit the free speech of Black activists.

209
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,250
-Civil rights activists--   -I know why it was passed.

210
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,870
‎Why the fuck is he teaching…

211
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:03,120
It doesn't matter why it was passed. It matters what it can do.

212
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,410
We're not sure what it can do.

213
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,500
-No one's ever been charged with it.   -That makes it exciting.

214
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,600
It's like virgin land. Undeveloped real estate.

215
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:13,580
-It's a law and they broke it.   -Of course, sir.

216
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,910
-Is there a problem?   -No, sir.

217
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:19,410
Say what you want to say, since I'm paying for your wisdom. Give me my money's worth.

218
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,200
Sir, there are people who will see this

219
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,660
as the Justice Department restraining free speech

220
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,580
and there were people who see these men as martyrs.

221
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,040
-Are any of those people in this room?   -No, sir.

222
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,750
You're 33 and you're about to be named lead prosecutor

223
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,000
in the most important trial in your lifetime

224
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,950
after being handpicked by the attorney general.

225
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:38,870
I'm about to do that right now.

226
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:43,350
But before I do, let me ask you, how do you see them?

227
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,250
-Personally or in terms of--   -Personally.

228
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,660
I see them as vulgar, anti-establishment,

229
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,370
antisocial and unpragmatic, but none of those things are indictable.

230
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:55,230
Imagine how impressed I'll be when you get an indictment.

231
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,540
-There's a bigger question.   -Which is?

232
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:01,450
Who started the riots? Was it the protesters or the police?

233
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,750
-The police don't start riots.   -They'll have witnesses who say they did.

234
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,950
And you'll dismantle them and win,

235
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:10,600
because, Mr. Schultz, that's what's expected of you.

236
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,770
You didn't show a lot of gratitude in there.

237
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:21,150
On top of everything, we're giving them what they want: a stage and an audience.

238
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,580
You think there's gonna be a big audience?

239
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,200
The whole world is watching!

240
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,850
Yes, sir, I do.

241
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:32,770
The whole world is watching!

242
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,190
The whole world is watching!

243
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,980
Get out! How dare you? Get out!

244
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,160
-Abbie!   -Are you all right?

245
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,250
Abbie, over here.

246
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,790
-I was, until I saw that.   -Most of them are on our side.

247
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,270
-We love you, Abbie!   -See?

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,000
Watch out!

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,150
Jesus Christ! How did you do that?

250
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,700
Experience.

251
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,290
Abbie, right over here! Over here! Over here!

252
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,250
You don't know what to do with the egg now?

253
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,480
No.

254
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,830
-Mr. Kunstler, one question!   -Bill! Bill!

255
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,500
All right. Hang on. Quiet down.

256
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:26,040
I want you all to meet a new addition to the defense team.

257
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,250
This is Leonard Weinglass,

258
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,540
one of this country's most talented First Amendment litigators.

259
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,080
-Bill, can you tell us--   -Go ahead, Sy.

260
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,620
What's the status of Charles Garry?

261
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,450
Charles Garry is still in the hospital.

262
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:41,450
You should contact his office for information.

263
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,040
-One more.   -Marjorie.

264
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,870
You're representing Bobby Seale today?

265
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:48,910
Oh, no, it's very important that it be understood that, uh,

266
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:51,620
for his own protection, his own protection,

267
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,620
I will not be acting as Bobby Seale's attorney today.

268
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,540
One more. Jack.

269
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:59,370
I was told that Hayden was the one who wanted to bring Mr. Weinglass in,

270
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:02,120
that Hayden has concerns about your seriousness.

271
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,700
‎-Well…   -This is William Kunstler.

272
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,230
You wanna find out how serious he is, meet him at a witness stand.

273
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:45,750
I understand why they're tryin' to smoke Abbie, Jerry and Hayden,

274
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,950
even Rennie and Dellinger,

275
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:49,910
but I can't figure out what the two of us are doin' here.

276
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:53,790
I feel exactly the same way, but this is the Academy Awards of protests,

277
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:57,440
and as far as I'm concerned, it's an honor just to be nominated.

278
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,850
What is that?

279
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,440
I've been keeping a list every day.

280
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,660
Americans who've been killed since the day we were arrested.

281
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,900
Why?

282
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,350
With the trial starting, it might get easy to forget who this is about.

283
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,750
-Fellas.   -Morning.

284
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,060
Good morning.

285
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,980
I just got a question about my seriousness.

286
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:34,700
Whatever's going on between you and Abbie, could you keep it out of this building?

287
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,480
‎I got a feeling this is gearing up to be…

288
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,560
-Fred.   -Bill.

289
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,230
Did you have breakfast this morning?

290
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,650
-What?   -Did you have breakfast?

291
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,650
-I did.   -Well, what'd you have?

292
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:14,950
What are you doin'?

293
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,580
I'm talkin' to him about breakfast

294
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,200
because that's all I'm allowed to talk to him about.

295
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,440
That's right.

296
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,040
-Bobby--   -We have instructions from our lawyer.

297
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,790
If you need me, I'm sittin' right there.

298
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,100
You just look at me and you say, "I need you."

299
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,440
-We don't need you, Bill.   -You two gonna be like this?

300
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,290
Your friends shouldn't sit together. The jury's not gonna like that.

301
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,160
This isn't my jury. If they don't like it--

302
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,600
No, he's right.

303
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,310
Spread out, okay? In pairs.

304
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,940
And Fred?

305
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,690
-No, they're dressed just fine.   -It's all right.

306
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,020
And take your very scary hats off.

307
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,020
Don't mess this up.

308
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,230
All right. Good pep talk.

309
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,230
Hey!

310
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,690
You see the crowd out there?

311
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:18,540
I have an egg.

312
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,950
-Get rid of that.   -You don't think I want to?

313
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:23,790
‎It's like we're… What's his name? We just met him.

314
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,830
-Yeah.   -What is his name?

315
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:28,410
-Who?   -The drummer. The greatest drummer ever.

316
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:29,330
Gene Krupa?

317
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:32,200
No. Gene Krupa? I'm talkin' about the drummer from Cream.

318
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,700
We just met him last night.

319
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,020
-Ginger Baker.   -Thank you.

320
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:39,750
Crowd outside is so big, it's as if we're Ginger Baker, I was trying to say.

321
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:43,270
-Are you stoned?   -Yeah. You?

322
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,770
All right, sit down.

323
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,810
You remember what I said.

324
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,060
Okay, and you remember to keep us out of prison.

325
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:56,660
There's a lot of good advice this morning.

326
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,100
All rise.

327
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:10,580
Hear ye, hear ye. September 26th, 1969, ten o'clock a.m.

328
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:13,450
All persons having business before the United States District Court

329
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,910
of Northern Illinois, Southern District, Eastern Division,

330
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,870
draw near and ye shall be heard.

331
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,950
Judge Julius Hoffman presiding.

332
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,870
God save the United States of America and this Honorable Court.

333
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,480
Be seated.

334
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,060
Mr. Marshal, bring in our jury.

335
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:44,540
Let the record show that we have been joined

336
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,160
by our 12 jurors and four alternates.

337
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,900
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

338
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,440
Good morning.

339
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,830
Mrs. Winter, please call the case.

340
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,830
69 CR 180,

341
00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:03,450
United States of America v. David Dellinger,

342
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:06,620
Rennard C. Davis, Thomas Hayden,

343
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,870
Abbott Hoffman, Jerry C. Rubin,

344
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:15,700
Lee Weiner, John R. Froines and Bobby G. Seale for trial.

345
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,120
Are the People ready to make opening arguments?

346
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,160
We are, Your Honor.

347
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,450
-I don't have my lawyer here.   -It's not your turn to speak.

348
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,330
My trial's begun without my lawyer.

349
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,560
Please sit.

350
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,150
Mr. Schultz?

351
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,620
Good morning. My name is Richard Schultz.

352
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:41,700
I'm an assistant US attorney for the Southern District of Illinois.

353
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:44,660
Seated at my table is my boss, US Attorney Thomas Foran.

354
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,350
Or you could say, I'm seated at his table.

355
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:51,000
At the defense table are the eight defendants

356
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,850
represented by their lawyers William Kunstler, Leonard Weinglass.

357
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,790
Now, the defendants would tell you that they represent three different groups.

358
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,770
-They would tell you that one group is--   -Excuse me.

359
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,080
Yes, sir.

360
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,290
I'd like to clarify something for the jurors.

361
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,120
There are two Hoffmans in this courtroom.

362
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,190
The defendant Abbie Hoffman and myself, Judge Julius Hoffman.

363
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,660
Thank you, sir.

364
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,250
I didn't want there to be confusion on the matter.

365
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:21,900
Man, I don't think they're gonna mix us up.

366
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,910
You will address this court as Judge or Your Honor,

367
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,910
‎and you will not address this court until…

368
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,060
You will not address this court!

369
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,330
The defendants would tell you they represent three different groups.

370
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,580
And the record should reflect

371
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,660
that defendant Hoffman and I are not related.

372
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,480
Father, no!

373
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,100
Mr. Hoffman, are you familiar with contempt of court?

374
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:52,270
It's practically a religion for me, sir.

375
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:56,150
-Your Honor?   -Continue.

376
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,770
Rennie Davis and Tom Hayden are the leaders of the SDS, Students for a Democratic Society.

377
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,790
Davis and Hayden brought their people to Chicago

378
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,580
for the purpose of causing violence in the streets

379
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,250
in order to disrupt the Democratic Convention.

380
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:16,520
You know the Youth International Party as the Yippies.

381
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:19,620
Their leaders are Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin.

382
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,400
Bobby Seale is the leader of the Black Panther Party.

383
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,500
Again, the defendants would tell you that these are three distinct groups.

384
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,410
-But they all--   -Excuse me.

385
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,330
Yes.

386
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,400
-May I speak?   -No, sir.

387
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,700
He just said my name.

388
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,540
You're a defendant in this case. You're likely to hear your name.

389
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:41,370
I have a right to counsel, and His Honor knows that.

390
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:45,940
Don't tell the court what it does and does not know. Be seated.

391
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,650
Mr. Schultz.

392
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,700
The radical left. That's all.

393
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,830
They're the radical left in different costumes.

394
00:22:57,830 --> 00:22:59,660
These defendants had a plan,

395
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,900
and a plan among two or more people is a conspiracy.

396
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:05,790
The defendants crossed state lines to execute their plan.

397
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:09,410
That's why we're in federal court, and the plan was to incite a riot,

398
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:12,150
and there's one thing you already know.

399
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,660
They succeeded.

400
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:19,100
Excuse me. Have we identified the other defendants for the record?

401
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,600
‎A Mr… Wiener.

402
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:22,750
Weiner.

403
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:25,330
Mr. Froines and Mr. Dillinger.

404
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,850
Dellinger, Your Honor.

405
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,770
What's going on here?

406
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,830
Uh, you're referring to the defendant Dellinger.

407
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,150
Derringer.

408
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,160
Um, it's Dellinger, sir.

409
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,370
Note the prosecution was referring to the defendant Derringer.

410
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,000
-Not Dellinger.   -It is Dellinger, Your Honor.

411
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Can we straighten this out?

412
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,620
Sure. Dillinger was a bank robber.

413
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,910
Derringer is a gun.

414
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,000
He's David Dellinger, and the judge and I are not related.

415
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,580
Your Honor, I'd like to caution the court that this kind of disruption

416
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,250
and display of disrespect will be a continuing tactic for defense.

417
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,870
Sir, it's not a tactic.

418
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:03,700
At the moment, the defendants are the only ones on record as knowing their own names.

419
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,850
‎Be seated, Mr. Schultz…

420
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:08,230
Uh, Mr. Kunstler.

421
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:12,370
I object to being characterized as a member of this group.

422
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:14,790
-Who is your lawyer?   -Charles R. Garry.

423
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:16,700
Is Mr. Garry here today?

424
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,160
-No, he is not.   -Your Honor--

425
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,790
Are you representing Mr. Seale?

426
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:21,940
-No, sir.   -Then, sit.

427
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,480
Mr. Schultz, forgive me.

428
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,190
Have you concluded your opening statement?

429
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,910
Yes, Your Honor.

430
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:33,830
My lawyer Charles Garry is in a hospital in Oakland

431
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:37,060
-having undergone gallbladder surgery.   -Mr. Kunstler.

432
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,750
You are sitting right next to the man.

433
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:42,200
Just represent him. It's the same case.

434
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,120
The fact that there's a lawyer near Mr. Seale

435
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,700
does not satisfy the requirements of due process.

436
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,870
I have a right--

437
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:53,910
A motion was made for postponement due to Mr. Garry's medical condition.

438
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,700
I was there. Your Honor denied that motion.

439
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,870
Therefore, Mr. Seale is here without legal representation.

440
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:04,750
I don't care for your general tone, Mr. Kunstler.

441
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:07,120
I meant no disrespect to the court.

442
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,790
I'm trying to be clear that I can't muddy Mr. Seale's grounds for appeal

443
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,580
by appearing to speak as his lawyer.

444
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,120
I don't ask you to compromise Mr. Seale's position, sir.

445
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,500
But I will not permit him to address the jury

446
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,040
when his perfectly competent lawyer is sitting--

447
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,810
For the fourth time, he's not Bobby's lawyer.

448
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,690
‎You're, uh… Mr. Rubin.

449
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:33,120
Yes, sir.

450
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,980
Don't ever do that again!

451
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,250
Your Honor, I'm not with these guys.

452
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,330
I never met most of them until the indictment.

453
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,750
-We will have order.   -There are eight of us here.

454
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,790
There are signs out there that read, "Free the Chicago 7." I'm not with them!

455
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,540
-Mr. Marshal,   -Conspiracy?

456
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,870
-will you seat Mr. Seale?   -I never met most of them.

457
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,580
Frankly, the US attorney wanted a Negro defendant to scare the jury.

458
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,080
I was thrown in to make the group look scarier.

459
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,200
I came to Chicago. I made a speech!

460
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,040
-Mr. Seale--   -I had a chicken pot pie,

461
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,450
went to the airport and I flew back to Oakland,

462
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,000
‎that's why they call it the Chicago… Get your hands off me!

463
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,440
Charge Mr. Seale with one count of contempt of court.

464
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,290
We have to make a decision right now,

465
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,410
a decision I assumed we'd already made four months ago when trial prep began.

466
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,750
Are we using this trial to defend ourselves against very serious charges

467
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,900
that could land us in prison for ten years?

468
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,580
Or to say a pointless "fuck you" to the establishment?

469
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,060
‎-Fuck you!   -That is what I was afraid…

470
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,620
-Were you saying "fuck you" or answering--   -I was also confused.

471
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,200
If we leave without saying anything about why we came in the first place,

472
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,370
it'll be heartbreaking.

473
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,790
If the jury finds us guilty, we're not leaving at all.

474
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,450
The only thing we need to say about why we came here

475
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:13,600
is it wasn't to incite violence.

476
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,310
I'm with Jerry.

477
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,790
-Why?   -The trial shouldn't be about us.

478
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:22,650
I would love it if it wasn't about us, but it definitely is. John? Lee?

479
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,700
Does anyone think our judge is crazy?

480
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,250
-He isn't our problem.   -Give it time. He will be.

481
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:31,250
I'm talking about us. Abbie, you cannot talk back to the judge.

482
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,830
‎And, Jerry… Jesus!

483
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:34,980
Did you get a haircut just for court?

484
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,080
-I did.   -A haircut for the judge.

485
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,310
‎That is…

486
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,080
‎I can't even. That is…

487
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,830
That is so foreign to me.

488
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,410
-So is soap.   -Zing.

489
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:48,660
Let me explain something. It took you two less than five minutes

490
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:52,500
to make us look exactly like what Schultz is trying to make us look like.

491
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,700
I don't have a problem with what we look like.

492
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:57,370
Jerry likes what we look like. Uh, John?

493
00:27:57,370 --> 00:27:58,540
-Lee?   -Yeah.

494
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:02,200
-I feel like I'm ten pounds too heavy.   -I don't like it when we fight.

495
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,080
-Rennie?   -Tom should be heard.

496
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,440
And he was.

497
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:10,200
When we walked in here, they were chanting that the whole world is watching.

498
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
This is it. We're on.

499
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,250
This is what revolution looks like. Real revolution. Cultural revolution.

500
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,600
Why did you come here?

501
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,870
I got an invitation from a grand jury.

502
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,310
Last summer. Why did you come to the convention?

503
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,500
To end the war.

504
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,830
Guys, before you tether yourselves to this man,

505
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,330
just know the very last thing he wants is for the war to end.

506
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,410
I don't have time for cultural revolution. It distracts from actual revolution.

507
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,330
All right, all right, all right.

508
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:39,330
But you got time for a haircut.

509
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,650
Has everybody got everything off their chest?

510
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,290
What in the name of hell was that?

511
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,500
Evidently not.

512
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,040
You spoke for Bobby.

513
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,540
I made it very clear that I'm not his lawyer.

514
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,830
-I'd like to sit in on these meetings.   -You can't.

515
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,700
-I think I will anyway.   -Fred--

516
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,040
Bobby's life is at stake. You're playing to the crowd.

517
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,830
-Thank you.   -Shut up.

518
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:00,620
White guys sitting in a furnished room eating sandwiches while Bobby's in a cell.

519
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,200
White guys are free on bail.

520
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,750
Bobby's locked up because he's under arrest in Connecticut for killing a cop.

521
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:08,700
It's not like he refused to give up his seat on a bus.

522
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:12,540
Convince him to let Bill and me represent him, just for today, at least.

523
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,080
-The judge is--   -Fucking nuts.

524
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,690
A little hostile. I'm sure Garry didn't anticipate that.

525
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:20,660
He's innocent in Connecticut.

526
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,620
-All right.   -He's never killed anyone.

527
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:25,080
-It's important that you all know that.   -Okay.

528
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,560
All right, you gotta try to convince him.

529
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,270
I can't.

530
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:33,980
-Well, try.   -I have!

531
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,100
Well, keep trying, all right?

532
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,560
We're back.

533
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:40,060
Let's go.

534
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,750
Jerry, Abbie, unless you're asked a direct question,

535
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:46,290
I want you to keep your mouths shut in that room.

536
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:48,370
-This is a political trial.   -What?

537
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,270
This is a political trial that was already decided for us.

538
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:55,160
Ignoring that reality is just weird to me.

539
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,450
There are civil trials and there are criminal trials.

540
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:00,750
There's no such thing as a political trial.

541
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:02,230
Okay.

542
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,690
Abbie's smarter than you think he is.

543
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:24,730
Cows are smarter than I think he is.

544
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:28,520
-S-T-A-H-L.   -What is your occupation?

545
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,950
I am the mayor's administrative officer.

546
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:36,870
Calling your attention to March 26, 1968. Did you have a meeting on that day?

547
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:38,580
-Yes.   -Uh, with whom?

548
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:41,950
-Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin, is it?   -Abbie and Jerry is fine.

549
00:30:41,950 --> 00:30:43,450
What was said at that meeting?

550
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:47,410
I was told the Youth International Party would be holding a festival of life

551
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:49,830
during the Democratic National Convention.

552
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,370
There would be thousands of young people attending and there'd be rock bands playing in the park.

553
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:55,750
Music will be performed.

554
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,750
-Rock music?   -I would think.

555
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:00,410
They also said there would be public fornication.

556
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,660
Say that again, sir?

557
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,200
Public fornication.

558
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,790
You're asking for a Parks permit for public--

559
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,120
-Yeah.   -And rock music.

560
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
No, of course not.

561
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,330
What if it was R&amp;B?

562
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:12,520
-Did you issue the permits?   -No, I did not.

563
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:17,660
And what, if anything, did Abbie Hoffman say when you denied their request?

564
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,040
Mr. Stahl, you need to understand something.

565
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,700
There's gonna be a festival of life in Grant Park held during the convention.

566
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,540
Bands will play rock music. There will be public fornication.

567
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,370
Likely some of it with the wives and mistresses of delegates.

568
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:35,560
Psychedelic, long-haired leftists will consort with dope users.

569
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:38,450
And we'll insist that the next president of the US

570
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:40,700
stops sending our friends to be slaughtered.

571
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,290
This will happen whether you give us the permit or not.

572
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,870
Hotels will be filled with delegates. Where will people sleep?

573
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,620
Some will sleep in tents, others will live frivolously.

574
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,660
-How many people are coming?   -A lot.

575
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,040
What's a lot? A thousand? Two thousand?

576
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,120
Ten thousand.

577
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,650
-Jesus Christ.   -Right?

578
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,250
Did Abbie Hoffman add anything at the end of the meeting?

579
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:02,290
Yes.

580
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,160
‎-What did he say?   -He said…

581
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,080
Or you give me 100 grand and I could call the whole thing off.

582
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,520
Thank you.

583
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,200
Mr. Fineglass.

584
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,560
Uh, Weinglass, sir.

585
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,580
Mr. Stahl, the meeting you just described with Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Rubin,

586
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,830
was that the only meeting you had with any of the defendants?

587
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,870
No.

588
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:26,620
On August 2nd, you had a meeting with Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis.

589
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,200
-Tom Hayden.   -Rennie Davis.

590
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,350
On August 12th, you had a meeting with David Dellinger.

591
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,500
I'll tell you the same thing I told the others.

592
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,120
There were two more meetings with Tom and Rennie

593
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,410
on the 10th and 12th of August,

594
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:43,120
and one more meeting with David Dellinger on the 26th.

595
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,370
I can't be sure of the dates.

596
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,700
Well, I can be sure. They're recorded in the log at City Hall.

597
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,750
‎Okay…

598
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,910
And in each of the meetings, a request was made for a permit

599
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:55,790
to demonstrate in Grant Park during the convention.

600
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:59,080
Mr. Stahl, we intend a peaceful demonstration.

601
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,120
We're not interested in violence or disturbing the delegates.

602
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:06,040
And in each of the meetings, the request for permits was denied.

603
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,000
Listen, I'll tell you the same thing I told Mr. Hoffman

604
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,870
and Mr. Rubin and Mr. Dellinger.

605
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,160
No demonstrations within sight of the Hilton.

606
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,120
We have to demonstrate there. That's where the convention is.

607
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,830
There will be no demonstrations within sight of the Hilton.

608
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:21,480
Okay. But the thing is, there will be.

609
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,370
-Are you threatening me, Mr. Hayden?   -No.

610
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:26,910
We're not threatening you. We're cautioning you.

611
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,830
Thousands of people are coming to Chicago.

612
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:32,910
If they're not given a place to demonstrate, they'll demonstrate wherever they stand.

613
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:38,250
So it's reckless, irresponsible, and foolishly dangerous of the city not to have a contingency plan.

614
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,750
‎We're gonna need police security, first aid…

615
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,540
-Traffic control.   -Water, sanitation.

616
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,200
So, five times, you were asked for a permit.

617
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,750
Five times, you were advised of the dangers of not providing a location to demonstrate--

618
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,120
I don't take my instructions from the defendants.

619
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,540
-No, you don't.   -I don't.

620
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,480
You take them from Mayor Daley.

621
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,200
You're appointed by the mayor and you serve at his pleasure?

622
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,120
Yes.

623
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,650
And you're subject to removal in the same manner by the mayor?

624
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:08,910
-Yes.   -Thank you.

625
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,870
Further cross-examination, Mr. Kunstler.

626
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:14,500
Yes, sir. Mr. Stahl. When Abbie--

627
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,750
Excuse me.

628
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,770
Mr. Seale, would you identify the man sitting behind you?

629
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,950
-No, sir.   -No?

630
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:24,200
-That's right.   -Why not?

631
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,950
He's not on trial here.

632
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:30,730
Mr. Seale, identify the man behind you.

633
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,580
His name is Fred Hampton.

634
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,950
Let the record indicate

635
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:42,120
that Mr. Hampton is head of the Chicago chapter of the Black Panther Party.

636
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,370
Your Honor, Mr. Hampton isn't at the bar. Why is the record identifying him at all?

637
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:49,700
Mr. Hampton is clearly giving Mr. Seale legal advice.

638
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,040
My lawyer is Charles Garry.

639
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,660
Excuse me, sir, but for all you know,

640
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,700
Mr. Hampton is giving Mr. Seale the score of the White Sox game.

641
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:59,080
-I will assume that he is not.   -Why?

642
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,040
Because that's what happens when you don't have a lawyer.

643
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,500
The court assumes that you are being represented

644
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,900
by the Black Panther sitting behind you.

645
00:35:12,790 --> 00:35:14,060
Continue.

646
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,410
Mr. Stahl, when Abbie offered to call the whole thing off for $100,000,

647
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:23,790
did you think that he was serious or did you think he was making a joke?

648
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:26,700
I had no reason not to think he was serious.

649
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,290
-Really? Do you know what extortion is?   -Yes.

650
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,080
-Do you know it's a felony?   -Yes.

651
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,200
Okay. So, when you called the FBI

652
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,000
and told 'em about Mr. Hoffman's attempt to extort a government employee,

653
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,040
-what'd they say?   -I didn't call the FBI.

654
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,200
Sorry. When you called the US attorney and reported attempted extortion,

655
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,620
-what'd their office say?   -I didn't call the US att--

656
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,120
-Cooke County DA. Did you call them?   -No, sir.

657
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,080
-The chief of police?   -Mr. Kunstler--

658
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,700
The police officer posted outside the mayor's office?

659
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:55,480
How about the mayor? Mr. Stahl, I'm gonna ask you again.

660
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,540
When Abbie Hoffman asked for $100,000 to call the whole thing off,

661
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:06,080
did you think that he was serious or did you know that he was making a joke?

662
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,040
I had no reason not to believe he was serious.

663
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,410
Then, along with extortion, did you know that perjury is a crime?

664
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:15,790
-Objection.   -Sustained, and strike it. In fact,

665
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,950
strike the entirety of Mr. Stahl's testimony under cross-examination,

666
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:22,830
and the jury is instructed to disregard it.

667
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:25,870
You're gonna strike the entire cross-examination?

668
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:28,750
I gave you and co-counsel Fineglass ample--

669
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,750
Co-counsel's name is Weinglass.

670
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:34,200
Mr. Stahl's testimony under cross-examination is entirely--

671
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,910
You are interrupting the court again, Mr. Kunstler.

672
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:38,830
Move to reinstate testimony.

673
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,440
-Overruled.   -Overruled.

674
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,250
-Overruled.   -Exception.

675
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:50,310
Noted. Are there any further questions?

676
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,790
Yes. So, Mr. Stahl, in any of these meetings,

677
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:57,450
did any of the defendants say that if you didn't grant them permits,

678
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:00,040
that they would do violent acts to the city?

679
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,580
Yes, they said the Parks permit should be issued in order to minimize destruction.

680
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:08,730
Did they indicate from whom this destruction would come?

681
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,120
The destruction did not come from the Chicago Police Department,

682
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,270
if that's what you're suggesting.

683
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,810
No further questions.

684
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,830
I'd like to cross-examine the witness, Your Honor.

685
00:37:19,830 --> 00:37:21,660
-You may not.   -Have you met me?

686
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,230
Sit, Mr. Seale.

687
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,580
Are you guilty of conspiracy?

688
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,700
We believe that we are innocent.

689
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,500
The people who are guilty of conspiracy are the fuckers who put us on trial.

690
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,120
They are responsible for the bloodshed that flowed in the streets of Chicago.

691
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,620
Why won't Bobby Seale let anyone represent him?

692
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,400
You've posed that question in the form of a lie.

693
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,810
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

694
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:00,350
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

695
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,830
Conspiracy Office. Can you hold on?

696
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:11,410
Maybe you don't want to call it the, uh, Conspiracy Office.

697
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,500
They understand irony and appreciate the humor.

698
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,160
-I wouldn't count on it.   -Most people are smart, Bill.

699
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,980
If you believe that, you'll get your heart broken every day of your life.

700
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,160
Hang on. Hi, how can I help you?

701
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,080
Messages?

702
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,410
We sure do take contributions. We've got high-priced lawyers.

703
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,200
High-priced lawyers are working for free.

704
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,290
-It's the support staff.   -We can't take grass.

705
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,540
-Hey!   -Yeah.

706
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,790
-Abbie says we'll take the weed.   -Messages?

707
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,160
Let me give you our mailing address.

708
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,040
We are in Hyde Park,

709
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:44,100
‎28 East Jackson Street, Chicago, Illinois. 60604…

710
00:38:45,370 --> 00:38:48,250
I don't want you guys holding any more press conferences.

711
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:52,040
If you're gonna get between Abbie and a camera, I'd wear pads and a helmet.

712
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,620
We had a good day, Len. Tell him we had a good day.

713
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,540
Six and eleven.

714
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,830
-Yeah.   -What does that mean?

715
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,950
-Jurors six and eleven. They're with us.

716
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,160
How do you know?

717
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,910
Six made sure I saw a copy of a James Baldwin novel under her arm,

718
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,450
and eleven's been nodding during the Stahl cross.

719
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:07,790
Falling asleep?

720
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,980
Nodding. Agreeing.

721
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,870
No more press conferences.

722
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,870
Why won't Bobby Seale let anyone represent him?

723
00:39:13,870 --> 00:39:16,160
You posed that question in the form of a lie.

724
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,620
Bobby Seale's lawyer is Charles Garry. He's in the hospital right now.

725
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,370
A motion was made for postponement and it was denied.

726
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,830
Would you have taken $100,000 to call it off?

727
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:28,000
Yeah, sure. I would have taken $100,000.

728
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,620
‎As for calling it off…

729
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,950
How much is it worth to you? What's your price?

730
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,770
To call off the revolution?

731
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,770
What's your price?

732
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,980
My life.

733
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:17,020
Any idea what's going on?

734
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:21,730
It's been years since I've had any idea what was going on.

735
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,910
I'm going to adjourn the court for the day

736
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:35,660
and see counsel in my chambers in 15 minutes.

737
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,310
All rise.

738
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,790
Gentlemen, it's been brought to my attention

739
00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:46,910
that two jurors received threatening notes

740
00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,950
from a member or members of the Black Panther Party.

741
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,000
Which two jurors?

742
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,810
Juror number six and juror number eleven.

743
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,150
These were slipped into the mail at the homes of their parents.

744
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,940
Bring in juror six.

745
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,190
Six and eleven?

746
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:07,410
-Yes.   -Judge, I wonder if we could draw--

747
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,270
Juror number six, how are you?

748
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,790
I'm fine.

749
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,450
-Before we talk--   -Please.

750
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:15,290
Your parents received this note this morning in their mail.

751
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:17,790
They called the police, as they should have done.

752
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,690
I'd like you to take the note and read it out loud.

753
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,910
My parents?

754
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:24,600
-Your Honor, before she--   -Please read the note.

755
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,810
"We're watching you."

756
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,900
And you see who signed it?

757
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,370
"The Panthers."

758
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:37,520
You understand that to mean the Black Panthers, don't you?

759
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,330
You understand defendant Bobby Seale is the head of the Black Panthers.

760
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,410
-Judge, you can't--

761
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:48,900
He's chairman of the Black Panther Party. Do you still feel that you can render a fair and impartial verdict?

762
00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:00,660
Juror number six, your family has been threatened

763
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:02,480
‎and so have you…

764
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,230
by members of an organization that is led by one of the defendants.

765
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:10,150
‎Judge, for the love of Christ, she…

766
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:15,440
-I apologize, Your Honor.   -I would think so.

767
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,480
Do you still feel you can render a fair and impartial verdict?

768
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,940
No, sir.

769
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:27,600
You're dismissed from this jury. Thank you for your service.

770
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,830
Please bring in juror number eleven.

771
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:32,600
-I'm sorry.   -Keep reading James Baldwin.

772
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:43,080
Bill, I thought the Panthers were smarter than that.

773
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,330
-They are.   -Well--

774
00:42:44,330 --> 00:42:47,290
The Panthers don't write letters any more than the Mob does.

775
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,040
The moment I find out that it was your office that did,

776
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:54,020
you'll see the criminal justice system up closer than you ever wanted to.

777
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,040
-Who are the alternates?   -We're gonna make this public.

778
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,620
-Help yourself.   -Who are they?

779
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,540
Somebody other than the FBI has to investigate that letter.

780
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:17,060
Who'd you have in mind? Jefferson Airplane?

781
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,330
-The FBI investigates.   -This is bullshit.

782
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:20,620
Who are the alternates?

783
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,370
-Fucking bullshit.   -Clean up the language.

784
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,250
Kay Richards. 42-year-old dental hygienist.

785
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,540
That doesn't sound bad.

786
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:30,980
We think she's dating a guy named Tom Banachek, who works for Daley.

787
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,040
-We were out of peremptory challenges.   -How did this happen?

788
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,000
It's either her or that Korean War vet

789
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,750
who kicked his son out of the house for protesting the Vietnam.

790
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:43,700
‎You don't have to be Clarence Darrow…

791
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,750
Did they manipulate the jury pool? How come there's nobody who looks like me?

792
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,480
All right, raise your hands if any of you have ever shown up for jury duty.

793
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,950
No? Then shut the fuck up.

794
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,040
‎Bill…

795
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,600
Yeah? What?

796
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,310
He's sequestering the jury.

797
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,100
Of course he is.

798
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:07,290
No such thing as a political trial.

799
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:08,690
Good to know.

800
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:11,790
‎I…

801
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:17,230
I want an expert in geriatric psychiatry sitting in the gallery for a few days.

802
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:22,310
‎I want a medical evaluation of this… this judge.

803
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,370
The sequester's probably a reaction to Abbie doing stand-up on weekends.

804
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,660
It's not stand-up.

805
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:36,870
You're in a college auditorium in a spotlight telling jokes.

806
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:38,900
That's a little reductive.

807
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,910
Names?

808
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:43,480
Yeah. From yesterday.

809
00:44:47,910 --> 00:44:49,350
You hungry?

810
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,370
If I hadn't asked you to help me with Sara Beth,

811
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,080
-none of this would have happened.   -No.

812
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,200
I asked you to help with Sara Beth. That got us the first riot.

813
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,790
The first riot got us the real riot.

814
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,520
-That's not--   -Hang on.

815
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,910
‎Anyway, I'm telling stories. I always…

816
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,400
I'll add the names.

817
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:25,060
Thank you.

818
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:28,790
We move to strike the order for sequestration of the jury,

819
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,120
which was made by Your Honor, sua sponte motion--

820
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:32,690
Hold on.

821
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,690
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Hoffman.

822
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:39,150
What are you wearing?

823
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:41,950
It's an homage to you, Your Honor.

824
00:45:41,950 --> 00:45:43,980
Do you have clothes underneath there?

825
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,690
Yes. Hold on.

826
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,150
-Yes.   -Take off the robes, please.

827
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:56,450
Silence!

828
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:01,040
Bailiff, charge Mr. Rubin and Mr. Hoffman with one count of contempt.

829
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,190
Mr. Kunstler, continue.

830
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,830
We feel that sequestration,

831
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:09,330
for what appears will be a considerable period of time, can only--

832
00:46:09,330 --> 00:46:13,850
It would be a considerably shorter period if the defense made fewer objections.

833
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,370
‎…can only serve to the defendants' disadvantage.

834
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:20,410
The defense will make not one fewer objection than the prosecution

835
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:22,830
or this court gives us reason to.

836
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:28,440
Bailiff, charge Mr. Kunstler with one count of contempt.

837
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,160
May I continue my argument so it appears in the record?

838
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,450
You may continue.

839
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,160
The jury will be in the custody of the deputy marshals.

840
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:40,540
The marshals will take care of all the needs and wants of the jury.

841
00:46:40,540 --> 00:46:44,160
We feel that that tends to make the jurors sympathetic.

842
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,520
‎The jury are gonna be taken care of…

843
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,370
-Paul Deluca.   -And what is your occupation?

844
00:47:03,370 --> 00:47:06,330
I'm a detective with the police department, City of Chicago.

845
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:10,080
Calling your attention to August of 1968 during the convention,

846
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:12,250
did you have a specific assignment?

847
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:16,790
To keep Rennie Davis under surveillance with my partner, Detective Bell.

848
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:21,790
While you were surveilling Rennie Davis on the evening of Sunday, August 25th,

849
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,830
the night before the convention began,

850
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:26,620
did you observe Tom Hayden committing a crime?

851
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:31,350
Yes, Mr. Hayden was letting the air out of the tire of a police vehicle.

852
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,830
The park closes at 11:00 p.m. by order of the Chicago PD.

853
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,150
You must be out of the park by 11:00 p.m.

854
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:43,580
Violators will be prosecuted for trespassing.

855
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,230
I repeat, you must be out of the park.

856
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,770
It's a strategy of throwin' banana peels all over Chicago,

857
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,450
and the machine will stumble.

858
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:08,660
When it stumbles, it goes into a policy of overkill

859
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,190
and it starts to devour itself.

860
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,120
We gotta convince 'em.

861
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:17,690
We gotta convince 'em of what? That we're crazy enough to do anything.

862
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,000
We think it's important

863
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,830
for confrontational tactical knowledge to be understood.

864
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:32,000
You know it!

865
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,540
Right, confrontational tactics make us safer.

866
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,450
-Yeah.   -Right.

867
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:37,980
Why? Because the pigs become afraid.

868
00:48:38,370 --> 00:48:41,450
You know, and that's fighting fire with what?

869
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:42,580
Fire!

870
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,790
You don't fight fire with fire. You fight it with water, jackass.

871
00:48:45,790 --> 00:48:48,620
-It's a metaphor.   -Abbie and his fuckin' banana peels?

872
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,700
Also a metaphor.

873
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,080
Between the cops, the state police and the Guard,

874
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:56,200
Daley's got 15,000 soldiers whose guns are loaded with bullets that are literal.

875
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,410
I could argue that the bullets are also--

876
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:00,230
Yeah, so could I, but don't.

877
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:03,660
The atmosphere's getting dangerous and someone's gonna throw a rock.

878
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:06,540
I wanna get the word out we're protesting the war and not the cops.

879
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,650
-Damn it!   -What?

880
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,600
I think those are my guys.

881
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:12,850
I think that's their car.

882
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:18,060
Yep, that's them. They're back. They were following me all day.

883
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:21,830
Listen, here's the thing I haven't told you about Sara Beth.

884
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:24,000
-She isn't into this at all.   -Isn't into what?

885
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,060
‎When I'm with her and her family, I try to…

886
00:49:27,250 --> 00:49:30,020
‎I de-emphasize the…

887
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,040
-radical revolutionary part of my--   -Got it.

888
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,950
Her parents are letting me stay with them.

889
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:37,750
If I show up tailed by two undercover police officers--

890
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,230
-That'll be hard to explain.   -This isn't her world.

891
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,910
It's definitely not her parents' world.

892
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:47,120
-If I bring my world into their driveway--   -You could be in a healthier relationship.

893
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:51,230
I know, but until then, it's the one I got.

894
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:53,810
-So that's their car?   -Yep.

895
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:57,690
-Where are they?   -Looking for me.

896
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:01,400
All right, go back into the crowd and let 'em find you.

897
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,160
And then leave the park by the east exit.

898
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,040
-They'll need their car to follow you.   -What are you gonna do?

899
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:10,620
It won't remind anyone of Gandhi, but a little civil disobedience. Go.

900
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:14,400
-You're not gonna cut the brakes--   -I'll let the air out of a tire. Go.

901
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,450
I appreciate it. I don't wanna be a phony with Sara--

902
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,730
-You're welcome. You should really go now.   -Yep.

903
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,160
Detective Bell and I spotted Rennie Davis walking in the crowd,

904
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:28,750
and we observed him on foot for a few minutes.

905
00:50:28,750 --> 00:50:30,160
Then we returned to the unit.

906
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,000
-Your car?   -Yes.

907
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,480
What did you find?

908
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,540
-Don't fuckin' move.   -On your feet.

909
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:41,100
Those are two contradictory instructions--

910
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,440
All right, hands behind your head.

911
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,230
Spread your legs.

912
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,620
Was that a contradictory instruction?

913
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:49,790
No.

914
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:52,290
‎-What happened then?   -Someone from the crowd shouted…

915
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:56,350
-They're hassling Tom Hayden!   -Paulie, you need to see what I'm seeing.

916
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,290
-Hey! Stay back there! All of ya!   -Police! Stay back!

917
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,080
-Listen, everybody stay cool.   -Shut up. All right, tell 'em to get back.

918
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:08,620
-Again, that's a contradict--   -Tell 'em to get back.

919
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:10,870
Did he tell the crowd to back down?

920
00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:13,750
Everybody get back. I'm all right. Stay cool.

921
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:15,160
He was egging them on.

922
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:17,620
Did you take Mr. Hayden under arrest at that moment?

923
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,690
-No, sir.   -Why not?

924
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:21,000
Who's shinin' that?

925
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:23,400
Paulie, it's a camera. It's a TV camera.

926
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:26,000
We wanted to defuse the situation,

927
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,650
so we arranged to take Mr. Hayden in the next morning.

928
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,540
This is gonna be for me.

929
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,250
Let me try to explain to them.

930
00:51:35,250 --> 00:51:37,290
Tell 'em about Sara Beth's parents.

931
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,830
-Yeah.   -I was kidding.

932
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:41,290
Just bail me out and keep to the schedule. It's fine.

933
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:43,040
-Tom Hayden?   -Yeah.

934
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,870
-See you in a bit.   -You're under arrest.

935
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,100
Got it.

936
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,410
We'll stand in recess for one hour, and court will resume at 1:30--

937
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:53,250
Your Honor, I have a motion I'd like to bring forward.

938
00:51:53,250 --> 00:51:56,290
You wish to address the court, Mr. Seale?

939
00:51:56,290 --> 00:51:58,250
Yes. I have a motion--

940
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:00,230
I will hear you, Mr. Seale.

941
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:03,100
Just a moment.

942
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,580
Mr. Seale, do you have a motion?

943
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,410
"I, Bobby G. Seale, have a motion pro se to defend myself."

944
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:12,910
"I'd like to invoke the precedent of Adams v. US ex rel. McCann,

945
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:15,410
-where the Supreme Court is--"   -That's enough.

946
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:17,350
Where are you learning these things?

947
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,040
Does your young friend Mr. Hampton have a background in law?

948
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:24,620
Your Honor, the other defendants would like to join in Mr. Seale's motion.

949
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,790
Are you now speaking on behalf of Mr. Seale?

950
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:30,660
No, Your Honor, I'm speaking on behalf of the other defendants.

951
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,500
You're right next to him. Why don't you represent him?

952
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:36,160
Because I'm not his lawyer, sir.

953
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:39,660
And if I understand Mr. Seale, this last month and a half,

954
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,540
and I believe I have,

955
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,750
-he is not represented by counsel.   -Overruled.

956
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,870
‎-I am being denied right now…   -Mr. Seale…

957
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:50,700
‎…my constitutional right for legal representation--

958
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,520
Will you be quiet!

959
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:56,290
You have lawyers to speak for you.

960
00:52:56,290 --> 00:52:58,480
No, he doesn't!

961
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:17,700
Cite Mr. Kunstler with his second count of contempt.

962
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:19,270
All rise.

963
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:30,120
So, Hayden's in a holding cell on a tire pressure-related charge,

964
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,290
and suddenly, every freak in Chicago is mobilized.

965
00:53:33,290 --> 00:53:35,160
"They got Hayden!"

966
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,160
"We gotta march down to the police station,

967
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,200
overcome the cops and the Illinois National Guard

968
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,400
and free Tom Hayden!"

969
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:46,440
We couldn't find our way out of the park.

970
00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:53,410
Now, over the course of ten days, the government called 37 witnesses,

971
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:57,520
each and every one of them an employee of the government.

972
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:01,450
I call this portion of the trial "with friends like these."

973
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,940
Rennie, this is Sam. He can be trusted.

974
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,790
Detective Sam McGiven, Chicago Police Department.

975
00:54:06,790 --> 00:54:08,500
-Abbie, this is Stan.   -Oh, hey.

976
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,500
-Stan Wojohowski.   -How you doin', Stan?

977
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,790
-What is your occupation?   -I'm a Chicago police officer.

978
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:15,080
Scotty Scibelli, Tom.

979
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:18,120
I'm your guy for ass, weed or whatever you need.

980
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,520
Staff Sergeant Scott Scibelli, Illinois State Police.

981
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,480
It's from the woman in the glasses.

982
00:54:32,330 --> 00:54:34,270
-Really?   -Yeah.

983
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:46,290
Hey, uh, did you mean this for me?

984
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,700
-I did.   -Nobody's ever sent me a drink before.

985
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,330
-How do you like it so far?   -It's a Tom Collins.

986
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:54,290
I know it's a country club drink, but they're delicious.

987
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:59,080
A man in England named Tom Collins claimed in 1894 to have invented it,

988
00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:02,000
but then another man, whose name I've forgotten, said no,

989
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,790
he'd invented it two years earlier, and I think there was a lawsuit.

990
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:09,150
That's a surprising amount of controversy for gin and lemonade.

991
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:10,980
-I'm Jerry.   -I know.

992
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:15,620
Jerry, do you know why the French only eat one egg for breakfast?

993
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,660
-No.   -Because in France,

994
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:20,690
‎one egg… is un oeuf.

995
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,060
It's un oeuf.

996
00:55:24,830 --> 00:55:27,040
-Wow!   -I know!

997
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:30,100
I feel so much better about my Tom Collins story.

998
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,290
I'm Daphne O'Connor.

999
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:36,040
Special Agent Daphne O'Connor, FBI Counterintelligence.

1000
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:37,290
Spell your name.

1001
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:40,870
Think it's possible there were seven demonstrators in Chicago last summer

1002
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:43,700
leading 10,000 undercover cops in protest?

1003
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,250
What was your assignment in Chicago?

1004
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:48,540
To use Jerry Rubin to infiltrate the leaders of the protest.

1005
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:52,370
And you were with Jerry Rubin, Abbie Hoffman, Dave Dellinger

1006
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:55,540
and Rennie Davis on the afternoon of the 27th?

1007
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,450
Yes.

1008
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:59,870
-What were they doing together?   -They were leading a group of protesters.

1009
00:55:59,870 --> 00:56:01,910
-How many, would you say?   -About 800.

1010
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,790
Where were they leading these 800 people?

1011
00:56:03,790 --> 00:56:06,790
-To police headquarters at 11th and State.   -Why?

1012
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:10,790
Tom Hayden was being held there on charges of tampering with a police vehicle.

1013
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:13,850
Jerry Rubin said it was time to "confront the pigs."

1014
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,120
‎And by "pigs," he meant…

1015
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,730
It was time to confront the police.

1016
00:56:21,290 --> 00:56:23,350
Follow Abbie!

1017
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:25,900
Marshals, we're on the move.

1018
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:32,810
I remember also at the front of the group was Mr. Allen Ginsberg.

1019
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,910
Allen Ginsberg, the poet?

1020
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:37,790
Yes, he was chanting a kind of war chant.

1021
00:56:37,790 --> 00:56:39,830
-Whose street?   -Our streets!

1022
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,080
What's he doing?

1023
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,250
He's channeling the energy. Settling things down.

1024
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:44,700
And how's that workin' so far?

1025
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,700
-Whose street?   -Our streets!

1026
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:51,750
-Whose street?   -Our streets!

1027
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:56,580
The guy testified that Ginsberg was letting out a war chant,

1028
00:56:56,580 --> 00:57:00,540
some kinda fucking jungle signal to Beat poets,

1029
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:04,690
that they should begin pelting the troops with blank verse.

1030
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:09,950
So, a guy in the crowd is marching with a girl on his shoulders.

1031
00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:12,500
She's waving an American flag,

1032
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,200
and this seems to really be bothering some frat brothers

1033
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:19,000
who'd come to town in the spirit of fraternity.

1034
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,370
Put down the flag!

1035
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:22,410
Hey, put the flag down!

1036
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:25,500
Can you hear us? Are you fucking deaf, you bitch?

1037
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:29,660
-Put the flag down!   -Go to the kitchen and make me a sandwich!

1038
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:31,950
I'm gonna go back there and take care of that.

1039
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:33,330
They are not the enemy.

1040
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,480
In so many fuckin' ways, they are.

1041
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:39,310
Free Tom Hayden!

1042
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:42,400
Free Tom Hayden!

1043
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,000
The group turned left on 11th Street.

1044
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
We make a left on 11th Street.

1045
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,160
That's when they saw it.

1046
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:56,100
-Free Tom Hayden!   -Free Tom Hayden!

1047
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,900
Holy shit!

1048
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:09,060
Are they about to conquer Spain?

1049
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:14,940
Fuck it.

1050
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:16,700
What do you mean, "Fuck it"?

1051
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,730
This is it. It's time.

1052
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,950
-We're not rushing the police.   -Why the fuck not?

1053
00:58:21,950 --> 00:58:25,200
-We'll be critically injured.   -Tom doesn't want anyone hurt.

1054
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,450
Turn this crowd around. There's too much momentum.

1055
00:58:27,450 --> 00:58:30,250
-Turn 'em around and calm them down.   -What are we doin'?

1056
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,500
He's right. This is not safe. I know something about this. Come on.

1057
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,540
Marshals, turn 'em around and slow 'em down.

1058
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:38,080
Looks like the Alamo back here. Turn 'em around.

1059
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:40,950
-Bring 'em safely to the park.   -We should be marching up to them.

1060
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:43,400
I don't think they'll surrender, man.

1061
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,370
Keep 'em movin'. Dave and I are gonna stay and make Tom's bail.

1062
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:48,980
Back to the park!

1063
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,940
I don't carry money, do you?

1064
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:54,900
I do. I'm a grown man.

1065
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,500
You're killin' me, Allen. You're goddamn killing me!

1066
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:01,080
The marshals are spreading word that we gotta keep moving.

1067
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,700
"Go left on Roosevelt and back in the park," right?

1068
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:08,400
When they got to the park, three divisions of police officers had moved in from the south.

1069
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,120
I don't know what tactical genius came up with that,

1070
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,870
but you know when shit happens?

1071
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,080
When you don't give protesters a place to go.

1072
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:38,450
How would you characterize the mood of the crowd?

1073
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,830
The witness is in no position to characterize the mood of 1,000 strangers.

1074
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:44,290
Do you have an objection?

1075
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:46,250
-Yes, sir.   -On what grounds?

1076
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,650
On those grounds.

1077
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:49,330
Overruled.

1078
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:51,690
I will clear this courtroom.

1079
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,910
Mr. Wojohowski?

1080
00:59:53,910 --> 00:59:55,410
The crowd was looking for a fight.

1081
00:59:55,410 --> 00:59:58,580
You're pigs! Your children are pigs!

1082
00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:00,870
No, we should leave their children out of it.

1083
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,370
You're right. I know.

1084
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:05,000
"White honky MFers, get out of our park."

1085
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,450
And then he said, "Look at 'em."

1086
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:08,270
They don't look so tough.

1087
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,540
‎Well, the guns…

1088
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,870
There are no permits for this demonstration.

1089
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:14,910
You're ordered to leave the park, immediately!

1090
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,410
Put down your guns, motherfuckers!

1091
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:19,040
Fight like fuckin' men!

1092
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:21,700
Just so you know, I do not have your back on that.

1093
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:26,650
And the guys from Kappa Gamma Douchebag, who were hassling the girl?

1094
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:28,120
They're back.

1095
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:31,000
Put down the goddamn flag, you cunt!

1096
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
-Go make me a sandwich!   -Put it down!

1097
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,270
-Put the flag down!   -Calm down!

1098
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,500
Help me calm 'em down, Jerry!

1099
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:40,650
Baby, defuse the situation. They will listen to you.

1100
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,080
What?

1101
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:44,410
Nothing, that sounded nice when you said it.

1102
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:45,660
-Right now!   -Yeah.

1103
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:49,000
‎-Someone from the crowd shouts…   -A guy in the crowd shouts…

1104
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,950
‎Someone in the crowd shouted…

1105
01:00:50,950 --> 01:00:52,200
Take the hill!

1106
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:56,370
Hey! Stop running! Hey, everybody!

1107
01:00:56,370 --> 01:00:59,700
The street name for chloroacetophenone is tear gas.

1108
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,060
Fire!

1109
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,290
And it's a fuckin' blowtorch.

1110
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,790
‎Your lungs, your skin, your eyes…

1111
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,410
-Go, go!   -Riot clubs?

1112
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:11,600
They're made out of the same wood they use for baseball bats.

1113
01:01:31,830 --> 01:01:33,600
Let me go!

1114
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:43,520
Put the flag down!

1115
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,950
-Hey!   -You shut your fuckin' mouth!

1116
01:01:50,950 --> 01:01:52,230
What are you doing?

1117
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,330
You got this coming!

1118
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,950
What the fuck is wrong with you? Hey! Hey, get the fuck off of her!

1119
01:01:57,950 --> 01:01:59,330
What's the matter with you?

1120
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:00,940
Fuck you, hippie faggot!

1121
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,660
You're all right.

1122
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,440
You're okay. Here.

1123
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:09,830
You gotta just hold this over your face, okay?

1124
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:12,120
I'm gonna take you to the first-aid station.

1125
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,660
You're all right. I got you.

1126
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:17,270
‎We have to go. Okay, I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm gonna…

1127
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,700
Don't move, Jerry.

1128
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,810
-Man, get those guys. They were--   -You're under arrest.

1129
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:29,940
Everybody gather in the center of the park…

1130
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,040
After bailing out Tom Hayden,

1131
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:36,770
Abbie, Dave and Tom returned to the park. Is that correct?

1132
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,980
Sir, can you look at me? Sir?

1133
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:51,850
Get in.

1134
01:02:55,750 --> 01:03:00,080
I'll be honest. I was starting to worry about getting everyone out of Chicago alive.

1135
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:02,900
-That's not really up to us.   -Yeah, it is.

1136
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,100
What are you lookin' at me for? I went to bail you out.

1137
01:03:06,290 --> 01:03:08,540
800 people followed you?

1138
01:03:08,540 --> 01:03:12,540
Oh, that. Yeah, people follow me. Hell if I know why.

1139
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,330
I'm racking my brain as well.

1140
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,080
How'd you make bail so fast?

1141
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:18,750
I wasn't arrested, I was detained.

1142
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:21,080
They couldn't figure out what to charge me with.

1143
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,480
Assault.

1144
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:26,370
I was assaulting someone who was assaulting someone.

1145
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:27,540
-So--   -Okay, guys.

1146
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,500
Nothing is more dangerous than a crowd of people moving.

1147
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:33,440
It's like trying to redirect the Mississippi River.

1148
01:03:33,950 --> 01:03:36,370
-Isn't she great?   -Get your people to cool off.

1149
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:38,950
-We're responsible for these people.   -Tommy.

1150
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:41,200
We have to protest in front of the convention.

1151
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:44,540
Plain and simple. 'Cause that's where the cameras are.

1152
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:48,200
We have to get to the convention. That means we have to leave the park.

1153
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,040
And that's when people'll get hurt.

1154
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:54,120
As long as every person following me knows that, then I sleep fine at night.

1155
01:03:54,120 --> 01:03:55,750
Tell me how you do it.

1156
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,940
-A lot of it is drugs.   -Yeah?

1157
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,060
This is what happened when we try to go up a hill.

1158
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:04,850
We're not getting anywhere near the convention.

1159
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,950
Special Agent O'Connor, you testified that Jerry Rubin said,

1160
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:15,940
"Fuck 'em all. They're all pigs. We should form an army and get guns."

1161
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:17,080
Yes.

1162
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:20,120
And when he said that, did anyone form an army and get guns?

1163
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:21,040
No.

1164
01:04:21,040 --> 01:04:25,020
Did Jerry Rubin instruct the crowd to run into the park?

1165
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,080
-No.   -Did Rennie Davis?

1166
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:29,870
-No.   -Was Abbie Hoffman even there?

1167
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:31,830
-No.   -Was Dave Dellinger?

1168
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,910
-No.   -John Froines there?

1169
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,690
-No.   -Lee Weiner?

1170
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,330
No, he wasn't there.

1171
01:04:37,330 --> 01:04:39,950
‎You testified that Jerry and Rennie…

1172
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:41,790
Can you say it for me again?

1173
01:04:41,790 --> 01:04:44,500
That they were trying to turn the people around

1174
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:48,270
and send them back down the hill just like you told them to.

1175
01:04:48,790 --> 01:04:50,440
Is that correct?

1176
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,580
Mr. Kunstler, the demonstrators attacked the police

1177
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,310
and the police responded.

1178
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:04,580
And are any of those demonstrators that you saw attacking the police

1179
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,950
sitting here at the defense table?

1180
01:05:06,950 --> 01:05:09,980
-No, sir.   -Well, thank you.

1181
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:12,080
No further questions.

1182
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:14,160
-The court will stand--   -I wasn't there, either.

1183
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,040
-Mr. Seale--   -I wasn't there at all.

1184
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,410
I should be allowed to cross-examine this witness!

1185
01:05:18,410 --> 01:05:21,080
-We will stand in recess until--   -Four hours!

1186
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:22,160
Mr. Hampton!

1187
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,120
That's how long Bobby Seale was in Chicago.

1188
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,100
-Quiet!   -Four hours!

1189
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:34,770
All rise.

1190
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:42,650
The court will stand in recess for the weekend.

1191
01:05:49,370 --> 01:05:51,160
Yeah, I took in the exhibit.

1192
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,400
I cleared my mind.

1193
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:57,520
Stood there for 20 minutes. I felt nothing.

1194
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:03,850
Well, but it wasn't a painting, it was an exhibit.

1195
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,700
It was a natural history museum.

1196
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,700
And when you put exhibits of Native Indian families

1197
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,330
in a natural history museum

1198
01:06:10,330 --> 01:06:13,580
alongside dioramas of early man and the Jurassic age,

1199
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,730
it gives the impression that the Cherokee evolved into modern-day Europeans.

1200
01:06:19,410 --> 01:06:20,940
Look who it is.

1201
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:23,160
I got a bone to pick with that guy.

1202
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,730
Hey, Counselor.

1203
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,040
-No colleges this weekend?   -Winter break.

1204
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,440
My audience went home to their parents.

1205
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:32,410
Are these ladies related to you?

1206
01:06:32,410 --> 01:06:34,870
These are my daughters. This is Emily and Julie.

1207
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:36,290
Your dad's a good guy.

1208
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,330
That's coming from someone who he's trying hard to put in prison.

1209
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:41,370
We shouldn't be talking without your lawyer.

1210
01:06:41,370 --> 01:06:43,020
We're all on the same team.

1211
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,750
In a sense, I guess, but in a much truer sense, we're not.

1212
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:49,250
Girls, here, take this dollar

1213
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:53,000
and go over to those musicians and put it in their hat, okay?

1214
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,040
And here's a quarter. Go buy some of those candy-coated peanuts

1215
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:59,190
that your mom won't let you have. All right? Shh.

1216
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,950
-Sweet kids.   -Thank you.

1217
01:07:01,950 --> 01:07:06,940
If your lawyer were here, I'd tell you the window's closing for you to plead out.

1218
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:09,850
We're not taking a fuckin' deal. Would you stop?

1219
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:13,080
I wish I could share Abbie's sentiment that you're a good guy,

1220
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,650
but I'm afraid I can't.

1221
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,410
I'm sorry to hear that.

1222
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:20,410
Sending Daphne O'Connor to break my heart was way out of line.

1223
01:07:20,410 --> 01:07:22,950
Well, I don't work for the FBI,

1224
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:26,120
but O'Connor was one of many agents sent to gather intelligence

1225
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:27,950
on what had been deemed a credible threat.

1226
01:07:27,950 --> 01:07:31,980
Fine. Then you bug our phones, you wire up a dope dealer. Be a man.

1227
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:36,040
-You don't send a woman to ensorcell me.   -What?

1228
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,830
It means to enchant.

1229
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:41,980
-Only to have her crush my soul.   -How long did you two know each other?

1230
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:45,450
Ninety-three hours. Could've been a lifetime.

1231
01:07:45,450 --> 01:07:47,660
For a fruit fly. Enjoy your weekend.

1232
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,770
Is that even ethical?

1233
01:07:50,330 --> 01:07:51,830
Aren't there ethics rules?

1234
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,600
Did she engage with you sexually?

1235
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,150
Well, we were takin' it slow.

1236
01:07:57,700 --> 01:07:59,410
He's gonna be all right.

1237
01:07:59,410 --> 01:08:01,060
One egg is un oeuf?

1238
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:04,330
-They teach her that at the Academy?   -Yep.

1239
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,250
We don't have any beef with you.

1240
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:09,290
We know you're doing your job and you don't think we're criminals.

1241
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:11,040
I'm not sure where you get that info,

1242
01:08:11,040 --> 01:08:14,190
but I represent the People without passion or prejudice.

1243
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,650
You think we were responsible?

1244
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:19,020
You got the result you were looking for.

1245
01:08:19,540 --> 01:08:20,810
So did Nixon.

1246
01:08:21,370 --> 01:08:24,940
How 'bout that? See you Monday.

1247
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:28,060
Does she ever mention me?

1248
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,600
Conspiracy Office.

1249
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:00,940
I need a second.

1250
01:09:07,330 --> 01:09:09,060
Something's happened, Tom.

1251
01:09:29,080 --> 01:09:30,690
‎Bobby, uh…

1252
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:36,060
Fred Hampton was shot and killed last night.

1253
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:43,650
There was a police raid, and there was a shootout.

1254
01:09:43,950 --> 01:09:45,560
And he's dead.

1255
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:51,480
-It took place between the hours of 4:00--   -I know.

1256
01:09:51,950 --> 01:09:55,100
-You were told?   -Yeah.

1257
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,940
I'm so sorry.

1258
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:09,730
The seven of you, you've all got the same father, right?

1259
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:13,350
I'm talkin' to you.

1260
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:17,500
You all got the same father, right?

1261
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,480
‎"Cut your hair…

1262
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:25,730
don't be a fag, respect authority, respect America, respect me."

1263
01:10:27,370 --> 01:10:31,400
Your life, it's a "fuck you" to your father, right?

1264
01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:34,400
A little?

1265
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:38,770
-Maybe.   -Maybe.

1266
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,230
And you can see how that's different from a rope on a tree?

1267
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:44,150
Yeah.

1268
01:10:44,450 --> 01:10:45,690
Yeah.

1269
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,310
He was shot in the shoulder first.

1270
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:55,250
You can't aim a gun if you've been shot in the shoulder.

1271
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:57,190
You can't squeeze the trigger.

1272
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:00,230
Second shot was in his head.

1273
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:04,350
Fred was executed.

1274
01:11:08,660 --> 01:11:10,060
Anything else?

1275
01:11:13,910 --> 01:11:15,150
No.

1276
01:11:28,580 --> 01:11:31,450
Calling your attention to the evening of the next day,

1277
01:11:31,450 --> 01:11:34,950
Tuesday, August 27th, were you in Grant Park?

1278
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:38,830
Yes. There was a "Free Huey Newton" rally going on.

1279
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:42,700
-Recognize any of the speakers?   -I heard Jerry Rubin give a speech.

1280
01:11:42,700 --> 01:11:45,290
Phil Ochs sang, and then Bobby Seale gave a speech.

1281
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:49,350
I object to this testimony against me because I have been denied counsel.

1282
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,400
We understand.

1283
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,330
Do you recall any of Mr. Seale's speech?

1284
01:11:54,330 --> 01:11:55,500
Yes. He said--

1285
01:11:55,500 --> 01:11:57,850
-I object to this man's--   -Quiet!

1286
01:11:58,370 --> 01:11:59,290
Go ahead.

1287
01:11:59,290 --> 01:12:01,310
-May I refer to notes?   -Yes.

1288
01:12:04,200 --> 01:12:07,200
He said, "We must understand that as we go forth

1289
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,500
‎to try to move the reprobate politicians…"

1290
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,000
Your Honor--   -"our cowardly Congress,

1291
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,410
‎-the jive, double-lip talking Nixon--"   -"Jive, double-lip, talking Nixon…"

1292
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:20,080
You're making me sound like one funky cat. Thank you, sir.

1293
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,600
Last warning, Mr. Seale.

1294
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:25,400
Did he say anything else?

1295
01:12:25,870 --> 01:12:28,250
He said, "The revolution at this time

1296
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:32,730
is directly connected to organized guns in force."

1297
01:12:34,540 --> 01:12:35,940
No more questions.

1298
01:12:37,290 --> 01:12:41,250
Jive, double-lip talking. Funky, funky cat.

1299
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:43,870
Would the defense like to cross-examine the witness?

1300
01:12:43,870 --> 01:12:48,250
Yes. I'm sittin' here saying that I would like to cross-examine a witness.

1301
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:51,250
-Only lawyers can address a witness.   -My lawyer is Charles Garry.

1302
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,150
-I'm tired of hearing that.   -Couldn't care less what you're tired of.

1303
01:12:55,540 --> 01:12:56,900
What did you say?

1304
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:04,200
I said it would be impossible for me to care any less what you are tired of.

1305
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:07,290
And I demand to cross-examine the witness.

1306
01:13:07,290 --> 01:13:09,500
Sit in your chair and be quiet.

1307
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:13,520
And don't ever address this court in that manner again.

1308
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,060
Are there any further questions?

1309
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:24,040
We'll stand in recess for one hour, and court will resume again--

1310
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:27,250
-It was premeditated murder!   -Yes, it was!

1311
01:13:27,250 --> 01:13:31,080
-Fred Hampton was assassinated last night!   -Marshals, put Mr. Seale--

1312
01:13:31,080 --> 01:13:33,120
He wouldn't have been able to hold a gun!

1313
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:38,270
When they publish the coroner's report, ask about the bullet in his shoulder!

1314
01:13:41,620 --> 01:13:44,940
I strongly caution you, Mr. Seale.

1315
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:47,040
I strongly caution--

1316
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:50,020
Oh, strongly fuck yourself!

1317
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:55,120
Marshals, take that defendant into a room

1318
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:58,100
and deal with him as he should be dealt with.

1319
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:29,410
Let the record show that I tried, fairly and impartially.

1320
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:33,500
I tried to get the defendant to sit on his own.

1321
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,790
I ask you again, Mr. Seale,

1322
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:39,650
and you may indicate by raising your head up and down,

1323
01:15:39,830 --> 01:15:42,160
or moving it from side to side,

1324
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:47,620
if I have your assurance that you will not do anything to disrupt this trial,

1325
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:51,060
if I allow you to resume proper order.

1326
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,440
Do I have your assurance?

1327
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:05,520
Mr. Schultz, call your next witness.

1328
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,350
Mr. Schultz?

1329
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:21,650
Your Honor, may we approach?

1330
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,900
Can he breathe?

1331
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:31,600
Can you breathe all right, Bobby?

1332
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:41,250
Your Honor, our defendant is gagged and bound in an American courtroom.

1333
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,200
He brought it on himself.

1334
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:44,250
Are you insane?

1335
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:45,770
Mr. Kunstler.

1336
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,900
Love of God.

1337
01:16:49,410 --> 01:16:52,200
What do you want, Mr. Schultz? This is your sidebar.

1338
01:16:52,200 --> 01:16:55,950
The government would like to make a motion that Bobby Seale be separated--

1339
01:16:55,950 --> 01:16:58,350
-Wait, wait, wait--   -Sir, please.

1340
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,620
A motion that Bobby Seale be separated from the rest of the defendants

1341
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,150
and his case be declared a mistrial.

1342
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:06,290
You want me to give him his mistrial?

1343
01:17:06,290 --> 01:17:10,950
Of course, because you took that Black guy and you made him a sympathetic character.

1344
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:15,700
Mr. Kunstler, I have lived a very long time, sir.

1345
01:17:15,700 --> 01:17:18,910
And you're the first person ever

1346
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:23,290
to suggest that I have discriminated against a Black man.

1347
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,600
Then let the record show that I am the second.

1348
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:29,770
Step back.

1349
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:48,520
I'm issuing an order declaring a mistrial as to the defendant Bobby G. Seale.

1350
01:17:57,830 --> 01:18:02,910
Mr. Seale, you are currently charged with 16 counts of contempt

1351
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:05,870
for your repeated displays of disrespect,

1352
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:10,100
and you have a pending homicide charge in Connecticut.

1353
01:18:10,500 --> 01:18:15,560
You are not home free, sir, and I doubt you ever will be.

1354
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:19,940
We are adjourned until 10:00, Monday.

1355
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,310
All rise.

1356
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:57,900
Conspiracy Office, how can I help you?

1357
01:19:03,330 --> 01:19:05,850
No, sir. I am a white woman.

1358
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:12,950
Yeah, I've slept with several in my life so far, and on balance,

1359
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,580
I'd have to say it is better.

1360
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:17,040
I think that's a big part of what's got you worked up.

1361
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:17,950
Hang up the phone.

1362
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:20,700
It's not so much that it's bigger. It's just better.

1363
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,060
Hang up the phone.

1364
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:26,440
Was that a parting gift for Bobby?

1365
01:19:27,080 --> 01:19:30,020
No. That was just for me.

1366
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:45,650
Why the fuck did you stand up?

1367
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:46,950
It was a reflex.

1368
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,830
He was respecting the institution.

1369
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:53,000
I don't know what good it does to insult the judge in view of the jury, the press,

1370
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,450
and Foran and Schultz, who'll recommend sentencing if we're convicted.

1371
01:19:56,450 --> 01:20:00,190
It's a revolution, Tom. We may have to hurt somebody's feelings.

1372
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:03,940
‎So, um…

1373
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:06,500
we have this list.

1374
01:20:06,500 --> 01:20:10,200
Maybe Monday morning, we could read the names into the record

1375
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,160
-as a way of saying--   -Saying what?

1376
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:16,540
That whatever we're facing, you know, it's peanuts compared to what--

1377
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:19,830
He's gonna sentence us. The judge decides what we're facing.

1378
01:20:19,830 --> 01:20:22,750
-It is a goddamn trial.   -Political trial.

1379
01:20:22,750 --> 01:20:26,200
‎No, we were arrested… The law doesn't recognize political trials.

1380
01:20:26,200 --> 01:20:29,480
No, we weren't arrested. We were chosen.

1381
01:20:32,120 --> 01:20:35,660
Lee, John, have you guys asked yourselves what you're doing here?

1382
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:36,580
Every day.

1383
01:20:36,580 --> 01:20:38,160
You're a give-back.

1384
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,790
They give the jury a couple of guys they can acquit

1385
01:20:40,790 --> 01:20:43,980
so they feel better about finding the rest of us guilty.

1386
01:20:46,580 --> 01:20:48,770
Lenny, am I wrong?

1387
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,660
No.

1388
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:54,750
Wait, so our role in history is that we made it easier to convict our friends?

1389
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,620
They're gonna find us guilty if they just don't like you.

1390
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,080
That's why Bill won't put us on the stand.

1391
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:03,060
I can take the stand. I'm easier for them to like.

1392
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:06,020
I'm literally a Boy Scout troop leader.

1393
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:13,370
You're a conscientious objector.

1394
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,330
A lot of people are conscientious objectors.

1395
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,580
During World War II?

1396
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:20,200
You sat out World War II. Even I wanna punch you.

1397
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,540
-We can talk about that.   -I'm looking forward to it.

1398
01:21:23,540 --> 01:21:25,100
I could take the stand.

1399
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:28,310
Mr. Rubin, you ever taught a classroom how to make a bomb?

1400
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,000
Man, eighth graders are taught how Oppenheimer made a bomb.

1401
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:34,200
Not one you can build with materials from Woolworth's.

1402
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,020
You know what'd be ironic?

1403
01:21:36,410 --> 01:21:38,500
-What?   -I said, know what--

1404
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:40,830
He heard you. He's asking what would be ironic.

1405
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:45,620
I was gonna say if John Mitchell did all this just to get back at Ramsey Clark.

1406
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,660
-For what?   -That thing, remember?

1407
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:50,450
Outgoing cabinet members are supposed to resign,

1408
01:21:50,450 --> 01:21:53,330
but Ramsey Clark didn't tender his resignation till--

1409
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:56,370
-I read Mitchell had a fit about that.   -Yeah.

1410
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:58,400
Did you read about that, Lenny?

1411
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,480
Bill?

1412
01:22:00,950 --> 01:22:03,160
He was never even on our witness list.

1413
01:22:03,160 --> 01:22:04,250
Who?

1414
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:09,230
‎-The first witness you put on the stand--   -If this was a political trial…

1415
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:11,500
-Bernadine.   -Yeah.

1416
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:14,190
I need my office to find Ramsey Clark.

1417
01:22:14,540 --> 01:22:17,690
And William Kunstler just showed up.

1418
01:22:32,410 --> 01:22:33,650
Len.

1419
01:22:38,290 --> 01:22:41,500
‎Maybe… I don't know, does he have a Secret Service detail?

1420
01:22:41,500 --> 01:22:44,940
Nah, they're here for us.

1421
01:22:50,250 --> 01:22:52,540
He was the attorney general. What do we do?

1422
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:55,400
-We just ring the doorbell?   -Yeah, I guess so.

1423
01:22:56,950 --> 01:22:59,650
‎-You wanna do it?   -Just ring the damn…

1424
01:23:04,910 --> 01:23:08,200
Good morning, I'm Bill Kunstler. Mr. Clark is expecting us.

1425
01:23:08,200 --> 01:23:09,440
Come in.

1426
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,440
Good morning.

1427
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,560
He's in his study at the end of the hall.

1428
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,080
Can I get anyone coffee?

1429
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,450
I tell you what, ma'am. That sounds great.

1430
01:23:26,450 --> 01:23:28,100
Nothing for me. Thank you.

1431
01:23:28,620 --> 01:23:30,400
At the end of the hall.

1432
01:23:31,160 --> 01:23:32,770
Mr. Hayden?

1433
01:23:33,540 --> 01:23:36,830
I read in the paper you were the only one who stood for the judge

1434
01:23:36,830 --> 01:23:38,810
after what he did to Bobby.

1435
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:43,580
Uh, that was a mistake. It was just a reflex.

1436
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:44,810
Tom?

1437
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,100
Hey, Bill.

1438
01:23:58,410 --> 01:23:59,980
Ramsey Clark.

1439
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:02,190
Pleased to meet you, sir.

1440
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,020
This is Leonard Weinglass.

1441
01:24:05,330 --> 01:24:07,660
-Mr. Weinglass.   -And Tom Hayden.

1442
01:24:07,660 --> 01:24:09,290
Oh, I know who Tom Hayden is.

1443
01:24:09,290 --> 01:24:11,940
The FBI used to work for me.

1444
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:16,410
Those two men, they're senior deputies with the Justice Department.

1445
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:18,150
Mr. Kelly and Mr. Ackerman.

1446
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,480
-I don't know why these men are here.   -I invited them.

1447
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:23,620
You invited them?

1448
01:24:23,620 --> 01:24:26,250
I don't want the appearance of impropriety.

1449
01:24:26,250 --> 01:24:27,830
There isn't any impropriety.

1450
01:24:27,830 --> 01:24:30,120
And now there are witnesses to that.

1451
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:33,950
Sir, these men are gonna call  Schultz and Foran

1452
01:24:33,950 --> 01:24:36,250
-as soon as we're done.   -Don't be ridiculous.

1453
01:24:36,250 --> 01:24:38,330
They already called Schultz and Foran.

1454
01:24:38,330 --> 01:24:41,900
And they're gonna call John Mitchell as soon as we're done here.

1455
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:44,190
Go ahead, ask what you wanna ask.

1456
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,810
-In front of them?   -Yeah.

1457
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:52,650
All right.

1458
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,450
Mr. Clark, while you were attorney general for President Johnson

1459
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,540
was there ever any discussion with the White House

1460
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:01,950
about seeking indictments against my clients?

1461
01:25:01,950 --> 01:25:03,870
-He can't answer that.   -Why not?

1462
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:04,950
It's against the law.

1463
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:08,120
That's an overly broad interpretation of the law.

1464
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:10,080
-If you'd like--   -I'll tell you what.

1465
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,370
We've dealt with jury tampering, wiretapping,

1466
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,620
a defendant that was literally gagged,

1467
01:25:14,620 --> 01:25:17,370
and a judge who's been handing down rulings from the bench

1468
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:19,700
that would be considered wrong in Honduras.

1469
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:24,000
So I'm a little less interested in the law than I was when this trial began.

1470
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,450
Well, whether you like the law or not, as former AG, he is protected by it.

1471
01:25:29,450 --> 01:25:31,560
No, you are protected by it.

1472
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:35,000
And with respect, sir, I can subpoena you.

1473
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,910
Find a judge in this circuit who will sign that subpoena.

1474
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:41,980
He's right. And taking the stand voluntarily would be a big risk for me.

1475
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:44,000
Well, again, with due respect, sir,

1476
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,770
‎my clients take a much bigger risk when they…

1477
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:51,080
‎-stand against an enormous power…   -What took you so long?

1478
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:54,100
‎…that they can't even see, and that…

1479
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:57,480
I'm sorry. What took me so long to do what?

1480
01:25:57,660 --> 01:25:59,520
To realize I'm your star witness.

1481
01:26:02,040 --> 01:26:04,790
‎-We were remarking upon that ourselves--   -Bill…

1482
01:26:04,790 --> 01:26:06,400
He can't testify.

1483
01:26:06,580 --> 01:26:08,540
I'm in private practice now.

1484
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:11,290
And if John Mitchell wants to cut me in half,

1485
01:26:11,290 --> 01:26:13,000
he can and he will.

1486
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:14,900
‎You have to find some…

1487
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,310
‎Sir, you have to find some courage now…

1488
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:22,040
-And--   -Find some courage? Yeah.

1489
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:24,790
Yes. You have to find some courage and--

1490
01:26:24,790 --> 01:26:26,150
Tom.

1491
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:32,120
That's what those two men came to tell me,

1492
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:36,480
that if John Mitchell wants to cut me in half, he can and he will.

1493
01:26:36,660 --> 01:26:41,230
So I wanted them in the room when I said,

1494
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,440
"When do you want me in court?"

1495
01:26:45,830 --> 01:26:47,350
Mr. Clark?

1496
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:48,980
I'm sorry?

1497
01:26:49,620 --> 01:26:50,540
Swear me in, Bill.

1498
01:26:50,540 --> 01:26:55,400
It is against the law for you to testify, Ramsey. It is as simple as that.

1499
01:26:55,790 --> 01:26:57,480
It's General Clark.

1500
01:26:57,790 --> 01:27:00,350
And arrest me or shut the fuck up.

1501
01:27:05,330 --> 01:27:06,770
Found some.

1502
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:11,440
Your Honor, the People move to disallow this witness.

1503
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,160
I'm sure the defense anticipated that.

1504
01:27:14,160 --> 01:27:15,950
Code of federal regulations mandates

1505
01:27:15,950 --> 01:27:18,580
the disclosure of Justice Department materials

1506
01:27:18,580 --> 01:27:21,870
is prohibited without prior knowledge of the attorney general,

1507
01:27:21,870 --> 01:27:24,750
plainly meaning the sitting attorney general,

1508
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:27,660
who is John Mitchell, who has denied his approval.

1509
01:27:27,660 --> 01:27:32,620
Judge, the rule refers only to very specific documents and information.

1510
01:27:32,620 --> 01:27:36,410
If the regulation were interpreted as Mr. Schultz is asking it to be,

1511
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:38,330
nobody in the federal government

1512
01:27:38,330 --> 01:27:42,150
could ever testify in any trial after they left their job.

1513
01:27:43,870 --> 01:27:46,660
I think the government is at least justified

1514
01:27:46,660 --> 01:27:50,250
in asking the defense to demonstrate, by voir dire,

1515
01:27:50,250 --> 01:27:53,160
the testimony it expects to elicit from the witness.

1516
01:27:53,160 --> 01:27:57,000
You'd like us to question the witness, this witness,

1517
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,000
outside the presence of the jury?

1518
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:04,810
If I find any of the testimony relevant, I'll call the jury back in to hear it.

1519
01:28:05,370 --> 01:28:07,480
Take it or leave it, Mr. Kunstler.

1520
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:13,150
Defense calls Ramsey Clark.

1521
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,310
State your name.

1522
01:28:27,450 --> 01:28:29,160
William Ramsey Clark.

1523
01:28:29,160 --> 01:28:30,830
Do you swear the testimony you give

1524
01:28:30,830 --> 01:28:33,330
will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1525
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:34,560
I do.

1526
01:28:37,290 --> 01:28:42,790
Mr. Clark, what was your occupation in the summer of 1968?

1527
01:28:42,790 --> 01:28:45,250
I was the attorney general of the United States.

1528
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,870
-You were appointed by President Johnson?   -Yes.

1529
01:28:47,870 --> 01:28:51,290
-Confirmed by the United States Senate.   -Yes.

1530
01:28:51,290 --> 01:28:56,620
Now, did you receive a phone call at your office at 11:50 a.m.,

1531
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,120
on September 10th of last year?

1532
01:28:59,120 --> 01:29:00,040
Yes.

1533
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:02,290
-And from whom was that call?   -President Johnson.

1534
01:29:02,290 --> 01:29:07,830
Will you state what President Johnson said to you and what was said to him?

1535
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:10,200
Your Honor, at this point, we will object.

1536
01:29:10,200 --> 01:29:13,950
A cabinet officer does not have to, and should not have to relate the contents

1537
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:17,330
of a private call he had with the president.

1538
01:29:17,330 --> 01:29:19,080
I'll sustain the objection.

1539
01:29:19,080 --> 01:29:22,540
‎Please, the court… This is voir dire.

1540
01:29:22,540 --> 01:29:25,250
I thought objections were reserved.

1541
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:28,370
There's a question of attorney-client privilege to consider.

1542
01:29:28,370 --> 01:29:31,600
The president isn't a client of the attorney general.

1543
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:36,520
Excuse me, sir?

1544
01:29:36,700 --> 01:29:39,830
The president isn't a client of the attorney general.

1545
01:29:39,830 --> 01:29:40,910
I'm happy to answer.

1546
01:29:40,910 --> 01:29:42,770
‎Your Honor…

1547
01:29:44,370 --> 01:29:48,230
Hearing from the witness on this point is highly irregular.

1548
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:50,730
‎Well, gentlemen, um…

1549
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,480
This is my courtroom.

1550
01:29:55,830 --> 01:29:58,400
‎But the witness is the former, uh…

1551
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:03,250
He's just stated his willingness, you know,

1552
01:30:03,250 --> 01:30:07,690
so, for the purposes of voir dire, I'll hear the answer.

1553
01:30:08,330 --> 01:30:09,560
Thank you.

1554
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:15,940
Mr. Clark, uh, did President Johnson ask you a question in that phone call?

1555
01:30:16,410 --> 01:30:20,080
The president asked me if I intended to seek any indictments

1556
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,900
related to the riots the previous month in Chicago.

1557
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:26,000
And what did you tell him?

1558
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,660
I told him we wouldn't be seeking indictments.

1559
01:30:28,660 --> 01:30:30,290
And can you tell us why?

1560
01:30:30,290 --> 01:30:34,790
An investigation by our criminal division led to the conclusion

1561
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:37,900
that the riots were started by the Chicago Police Department.

1562
01:30:52,750 --> 01:30:56,410
And, Mr. Clark, did your counterintelligence division

1563
01:30:56,410 --> 01:30:58,080
make a report as well?

1564
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:02,040
They concluded that there was no conspiracy by the defendants

1565
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:05,040
to incite violence during the convention.

1566
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:07,330
And then what happened on the first Tuesday,

1567
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:09,950
after the first Monday, in November of that year?

1568
01:31:09,950 --> 01:31:12,770
-Richard Nixon was elected president.   -Sustained.

1569
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,410
-Nobody objected--   -We do.

1570
01:31:14,410 --> 01:31:17,080
It's well-known there's no love lost between the witness

1571
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:18,620
and the sitting attorney general.

1572
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:21,160
This witness was called to wage a political attack

1573
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,330
and should not be allowed before the jury.

1574
01:31:23,330 --> 01:31:24,250
Mr. Kunstler.

1575
01:31:24,250 --> 01:31:26,620
Your Honor, you cannot possibly be considering

1576
01:31:26,620 --> 01:31:30,000
not allowing the jury to hear what we've just heard?

1577
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,120
The witness can't present them testimony

1578
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:35,000
that would assist in making a determination of guilt or innocence.

1579
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,580
He just testified his own Justice Department came to the conclusion--

1580
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,250
The current Justice Department,

1581
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:42,370
the one that matters, came to a new conclusion.

1582
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:46,250
Therefore, motivation of the prosecution has to be called into question.

1583
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:49,830
The motivation of the prosecution is not an issue in a courtroom.

1584
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:53,540
In any courtroom I've ever been in, except this one.

1585
01:31:53,540 --> 01:31:54,910
Object.

1586
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,410
Mr. Kunstler, do you have any further examination

1587
01:31:57,410 --> 01:32:01,660
that will demonstrate that this witness will make a material contribution,

1588
01:32:01,660 --> 01:32:04,370
or should I just ask him to step down?

1589
01:32:04,370 --> 01:32:06,350
You've ruled.

1590
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:13,540
You're not gonna let the jury hear his testimony.

1591
01:32:13,540 --> 01:32:16,120
Not unless you can demonstrate to me,

1592
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:18,910
which you have not thus far done, that this witness--

1593
01:32:18,910 --> 01:32:22,120
-Are you any good?   -Are you addressing the court reporter?

1594
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:23,660
-Keep up with us.   -Mr. Kunstler--

1595
01:32:23,660 --> 01:32:25,450
Is this prosecution politically motivated?

1596
01:32:25,450 --> 01:32:27,040
-Object!   -Yes.

1597
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:29,200
President Nixon inherited an unpopular war.

1598
01:32:29,200 --> 01:32:30,540
-Yes.   -Step down, Mr. Clark.

1599
01:32:30,540 --> 01:32:32,950
And your clients make it more unpopular every day.

1600
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:37,700
‎This administration is paranoid about the SDS, the Mobe, the New Left…

1601
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,060
Mr. Clark, please.

1602
01:32:40,370 --> 01:32:45,190
Please, sir. I will be forced to find you in contempt.

1603
01:32:45,410 --> 01:32:47,020
Do you understand?

1604
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:50,600
I do, Your Honor.

1605
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,020
Then step down, please.

1606
01:32:56,290 --> 01:32:57,850
Thank you, sir.

1607
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,770
Just get to work on the appeal.

1608
01:33:18,540 --> 01:33:21,650
Your Honor, when the jury returns,

1609
01:33:22,410 --> 01:33:26,330
will they be informed that the defense had called

1610
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:29,500
the former attorney general of the United States of America,

1611
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:33,650
but this court ruled that he couldn't testify?

1612
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:36,650
No, that motion will be denied.

1613
01:33:56,040 --> 01:33:59,980
Cite Mr. Kunstler with his third count of contempt.

1614
01:34:05,870 --> 01:34:07,200
You're a thug.

1615
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:09,500
Did one of the defendants speak?

1616
01:34:09,500 --> 01:34:13,370
I did. I said you're a thug, because you are.

1617
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:15,200
-Dave.   -Please sit, Mr. Dellinger.

1618
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:17,750
-If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?   -Dave.

1619
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:19,450
Marshals, seat the defendant.

1620
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:22,830
If we're guilty, which you have clearly decided--

1621
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,410
-Dave, I've got--   -Watch yourself.

1622
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:26,790
You've clearly decided that we were, why not--

1623
01:34:26,790 --> 01:34:29,730
‎No. You don't… No, you don't need to grab my arm.

1624
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,040
If we're guilty, why not give us a trial?

1625
01:34:35,040 --> 01:34:38,620
I mean, I have sat here for six months and watched you!

1626
01:34:38,620 --> 01:34:41,040
You don't need to grab my arm.

1627
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,250
I have watched you. I've watched you--

1628
01:34:43,250 --> 01:34:44,730
Sir--

1629
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,620
It's okay. He would not hurt a fly.

1630
01:34:49,620 --> 01:34:51,600
Take him out of here. Lock him up.

1631
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:56,270
I hit him.

1632
01:34:57,620 --> 01:34:59,270
I'm sorry.

1633
01:35:08,040 --> 01:35:09,350
I'm sorry.

1634
01:35:42,950 --> 01:35:46,190
There's only one thing. There's one thing to do.

1635
01:35:46,580 --> 01:35:48,270
Solidarity with Dave.

1636
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:52,690
Tomorrow, we go into court and get ourselves arrested.

1637
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:54,940
We're already arrested.

1638
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,940
Is Bill talking to you about taking the stand?

1639
01:35:58,160 --> 01:36:01,120
The press guys are saying Bill's been talking to you about it.

1640
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:02,540
He's been talking about it.

1641
01:36:02,540 --> 01:36:05,910
He thinks you might get the crowd worked up with a position paper?

1642
01:36:05,910 --> 01:36:09,810
Maybe he thinks I won't try to get the crowd worked up at all.

1643
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,750
Maybe he thinks there are jurors who relied on the safety of the police

1644
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:16,000
and are put off when someone calls them pigs,

1645
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,500
or maybe he wants a witness who dresses like a grown man.

1646
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:24,440
The cops in this city in the summer of 1968 were pigs.

1647
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:27,150
I wonder how many of them had kids in Vietnam.

1648
01:36:28,620 --> 01:36:30,540
He's gonna take the stand, not you?

1649
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:32,690
And we're okay with that?

1650
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:34,830
Abbie?

1651
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:38,100
What did you mean, the last thing I want is to end the war?

1652
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:39,250
What?

1653
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:43,450
Centuries ago when the trial started, you said, why did I come to Chicago?

1654
01:36:43,450 --> 01:36:45,580
And I said, "To end the war."

1655
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:48,410
And then you turned to everyone and you said,

1656
01:36:48,410 --> 01:36:51,900
"The last thing he wants is to end the war."

1657
01:36:53,620 --> 01:36:55,350
What did you mean by that?

1658
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:57,580
That you're making the most of your close-up.

1659
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:58,750
‎Yeah…

1660
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:01,690
-No more war, no Abbie Hoffman.   -What's your problem with me?

1661
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,950
I wish people would stop asking me that.

1662
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:06,160
-Dave wouldn't want us to--   -Answer it.

1663
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:07,650
One time.

1664
01:37:08,040 --> 01:37:12,830
All right. My problem is that for the next 50 years

1665
01:37:12,830 --> 01:37:16,040
when people think of progressive politics, they're gonna think of you.

1666
01:37:16,040 --> 01:37:18,870
They're gonna think of you and your idiot followers

1667
01:37:18,870 --> 01:37:22,500
passing out daisies to soldiers and trying to levitate the Pentagon.

1668
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,540
So they're not gonna think of equality or justice,

1669
01:37:25,540 --> 01:37:29,160
they're not gonna think of education or poverty or progress.

1670
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:32,040
They're gonna think of a bunch of stoned, lost,

1671
01:37:32,040 --> 01:37:35,980
disrespectful, foul-mouthed, lawless losers,

1672
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:38,150
and so we'll lose elections.

1673
01:37:38,830 --> 01:37:40,230
All because of me?

1674
01:37:40,700 --> 01:37:41,620
Yeah.

1675
01:37:41,620 --> 01:37:44,410
Winning elections is the first thing on your wish list?

1676
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:48,900
Equality, justice, education, poverty and progress, they're second?

1677
01:37:49,080 --> 01:37:52,810
If you don't win elections, it doesn't matter what's second.

1678
01:37:52,950 --> 01:37:57,120
And it is astonishing to me that someone still has to explain that to you.

1679
01:37:57,120 --> 01:37:58,400
Okay.

1680
01:37:58,830 --> 01:38:01,500
Okay, so, uh, Jerry was talking about standing--

1681
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,790
We don't have any money.

1682
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:04,080
I'm sorry, what?

1683
01:38:04,080 --> 01:38:05,980
We don't have any money.

1684
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:09,910
So I stage stunts, and cameras come and microphones come,

1685
01:38:09,910 --> 01:38:13,660
and it's astonishing that someone still has to explain that to you.

1686
01:38:13,660 --> 01:38:16,290
You're trading a cow for magic beans.

1687
01:38:16,290 --> 01:38:17,950
That ended up working.

1688
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:19,160
What?

1689
01:38:19,160 --> 01:38:22,040
The magic beans. There was a giant up there.

1690
01:38:22,040 --> 01:38:23,770
Oh, for fuck's--

1691
01:38:23,910 --> 01:38:27,410
I can't remember what happened after that. The little boy may have gotten eaten--

1692
01:38:27,410 --> 01:38:29,200
The giant turned out to be nice.

1693
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,290
-Are you sure?   -No.

1694
01:38:31,290 --> 01:38:34,000
It's hard to believe the seven of us weren't able to end a war.

1695
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,200
‎Let me ask you something…

1696
01:38:35,200 --> 01:38:36,540
You guys should shake hands.

1697
01:38:36,540 --> 01:38:39,950
Think Chicago would've gone differently if Kennedy got the nomination?

1698
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,230
‎Do I…

1699
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,400
‎-Just…   -Yeah.

1700
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:46,790
Yes, I do. I think the Irish guys would have sat down with Daley,

1701
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:47,950
‎and… Yes.

1702
01:38:47,950 --> 01:38:49,830
-I think so too.   -Yeah?

1703
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,440
That's why I was wondering.

1704
01:38:51,950 --> 01:38:57,480
Weren't you just a little bit happy when the bullet ripped through his head?

1705
01:38:57,910 --> 01:39:01,480
No Chicago, no Tom Hayden.

1706
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,750
I was one of the pallbearers, you fucking animal!

1707
01:39:04,750 --> 01:39:08,330
That's right, we're not goin' to jail because of what we did,

1708
01:39:08,330 --> 01:39:10,160
we're goin' to jail because of who we are!

1709
01:39:10,160 --> 01:39:14,060
Think about that the next time you shrug off cultural revolution.

1710
01:39:15,370 --> 01:39:18,440
We define winning differently, you and I.

1711
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:22,620
Bill, you should've seen it.

1712
01:39:22,620 --> 01:39:26,200
Tom tried to beat me up, but through sheer force of intellectual superiority--

1713
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:29,480
Stop talking. Just stop talking.

1714
01:39:29,870 --> 01:39:33,040
Foran's office turned this over tonight.

1715
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,650
In discovery.

1716
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,620
It was given to them by somebody in the crowd.

1717
01:39:37,620 --> 01:39:40,650
No foul play, there are affidavits.

1718
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
They really did just get this.

1719
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:44,080
What's on the tape?

1720
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:47,440
The sound of you starting the Chicago riot.

1721
01:39:49,330 --> 01:39:50,650
Hey. What?

1722
01:39:52,830 --> 01:39:56,160
Somebody had a tape recorder by the bandshell. They got you saying it.

1723
01:39:56,160 --> 01:39:59,040
It's a clear tape. You can't take the stand.

1724
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:00,700
-I can handle Schultz and the tape.   -No.

1725
01:40:00,700 --> 01:40:02,410
They'll play the tape anyway, right?

1726
01:40:02,410 --> 01:40:05,810
If you take the stand, they'll make you answer for it, and you can't.

1727
01:40:06,290 --> 01:40:09,540
-They'd just cracked Rennie's head open.   -So you started a riot.

1728
01:40:09,540 --> 01:40:11,540
-Defense rests.   -They had just cracked--

1729
01:40:11,540 --> 01:40:13,750
‎-If blood is gonna flow…   -Bill…

1730
01:40:13,750 --> 01:40:15,620
‎…let it flow all over the city.

1731
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:18,410
-They'd just clubbed Rennie.   -Everybody kept their cool.

1732
01:40:18,410 --> 01:40:21,700
Abbie, Dave... Shit, this guy kept his cool.

1733
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,250
You're the one who lost it.

1734
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:25,100
I can take the stand.

1735
01:40:25,450 --> 01:40:28,450
You wanna hear what cross from Schultz will sound like?

1736
01:40:28,450 --> 01:40:30,870
Sure. I'll show you what my answers will sound like.

1737
01:40:30,870 --> 01:40:34,810
They called him a radical, they called him a criminal!

1738
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,310
They called him "Un-American."

1739
01:40:38,040 --> 01:40:41,370
First of all, it turned out the guy climbing the flagpole was a kid.

1740
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:44,830
It seems like you guys attract an awful lot of underage minors.

1741
01:40:44,830 --> 01:40:46,830
-Do you wanna object?   -Objection.

1742
01:40:46,830 --> 01:40:48,750
-Overruled.   -We attract the people

1743
01:40:48,750 --> 01:40:51,120
who have the most to lose by this war continuing.

1744
01:40:51,120 --> 01:40:53,120
I'm glad you brought that up. Did you serve?

1745
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:55,870
‎I wasn't drafted. I didn't try to evade the…

1746
01:40:55,870 --> 01:40:58,830
-I had a high number.   -High number? But you didn't enlist?

1747
01:40:58,830 --> 01:41:01,250
I did not volunteer to kill Vietnamese people, no.

1748
01:41:01,250 --> 01:41:05,450
‎You testified you saw at least six policemen start to go after the man…

1749
01:41:05,450 --> 01:41:08,160
Sorry, the kid who was climbing the flagpole?

1750
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:09,500
-Yes.   -It was dark.

1751
01:41:09,500 --> 01:41:13,120
You were 100 yards away. What do you have, telescopic night-vision?

1752
01:41:13,120 --> 01:41:14,080
There were floodlights.

1753
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:18,290
And when they called him anti-American, he said, "No,

1754
01:41:18,290 --> 01:41:24,440
that ignominious distinction goes to those who mouth America's values

1755
01:41:24,910 --> 01:41:27,600
while breaking America's heart."

1756
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:31,160
I'd like to introduce you now

1757
01:41:31,160 --> 01:41:35,230
-to Carl Oglesby of the SDS!   -Come on!

1758
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:39,440
Hey, it's all right. He's a kid. We'll get him down.

1759
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:44,400
Isn't it great to be here in Chicago!

1760
01:41:47,830 --> 01:41:49,740
Come here. Son of a bitch!

1761
01:41:49,740 --> 01:41:51,730
Hey, leave the kid alone!

1762
01:41:52,330 --> 01:41:53,950
-Hold him!   -Hey!

1763
01:41:53,950 --> 01:41:55,500
‎Jesus! What is wrong with…

1764
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:57,580
Rennie was trying to get the police off of the kid.

1765
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,120
"Get the police off of the kid."

1766
01:41:59,120 --> 01:42:00,120
-Yes.   -How?

1767
01:42:00,120 --> 01:42:01,910
-He was--   -Grabbing them?

1768
01:42:01,910 --> 01:42:04,330
Get off of him! Hey! Get the--

1769
01:42:04,330 --> 01:42:07,700
I'd like to say to the cops back there that we're allowed to be here.

1770
01:42:07,700 --> 01:42:10,520
‎-We have permits for this.   -And out of nowhere…

1771
01:42:12,330 --> 01:42:15,910
It was six armed police officers versus Rennie and a pocket protector.

1772
01:42:15,910 --> 01:42:18,500
-I can understand that response.   -How about your response?

1773
01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:19,940
Let's press play.

1774
01:42:20,040 --> 01:42:21,580
‎We're gonna need medics…

1775
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,540
The whole world is watching.

1776
01:42:23,540 --> 01:42:27,440
The whole world is watching!

1777
01:42:27,620 --> 01:42:29,200
They've just beaten Rennie, Dave.

1778
01:42:29,200 --> 01:42:31,950
Listen. We can still get everyone out of here safely.

1779
01:42:31,950 --> 01:42:33,330
No, we can't.

1780
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:36,830
The whole world is watching!

1781
01:42:36,830 --> 01:42:39,020
The whole world is watching!

1782
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:42,410
Dellinger tried to stop you from saying what you were about to say.

1783
01:42:42,410 --> 01:42:44,190
Tell them to stay calm.

1784
01:42:45,620 --> 01:42:48,370
-No.   -Tom?

1785
01:42:48,370 --> 01:42:49,910
Did you tell 'em to stay calm?

1786
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:55,040
Wait, Rennie Davis has just been beaten by the police.

1787
01:42:55,040 --> 01:42:58,580
Rennie's skull has been cracked open.

1788
01:42:58,580 --> 01:43:01,160
-Did you tell your crowd to stay calm--   -Bill--

1789
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:04,450
I'm Richard Schultz, Tom. And John Mitchell told me to win.

1790
01:43:04,450 --> 01:43:06,830
Did you tell your crowd to stay calm or--

1791
01:43:06,830 --> 01:43:08,620
‎Yes. If blood is gonna flow…

1792
01:43:08,620 --> 01:43:11,000
‎…let it flow all over the city!

1793
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,540
-God damn it! Tom!   -If gas is gonna be used,

1794
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:17,450
let it come down all over Chicago! We're going to the convention!

1795
01:43:17,450 --> 01:43:21,020
Let's get on the streets! Get on the street!

1796
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:25,850
"If blood is gonna flow, let it flow all over the city."

1797
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:29,350
What was that, an order to start a peaceful demonstration?

1798
01:43:34,700 --> 01:43:38,020
Once you had a moment to settle down, did you try and stop people?

1799
01:43:47,950 --> 01:43:51,100
-Fuck you!   -Get off him!

1800
01:43:59,290 --> 01:44:02,410
-You didn't try and stop anyone.   -No.

1801
01:44:02,410 --> 01:44:06,450
The bridges! Head to the bridges! The bridges!

1802
01:44:06,450 --> 01:44:08,620
You told them to go to the footbridges.

1803
01:44:08,620 --> 01:44:12,290
The ones able to make it out of the park without getting arrested or maimed.

1804
01:44:12,290 --> 01:44:14,910
And those people, the ones you sent to the footbridges,

1805
01:44:14,910 --> 01:44:17,400
did they know what was on the other side?

1806
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,790
You are ordered to turn around immediately.

1807
01:44:26,790 --> 01:44:29,040
All access to the convention was blocked.

1808
01:44:29,040 --> 01:44:31,750
-By an armored division.   -The Illinois National Guard.

1809
01:44:31,750 --> 01:44:32,910
They're the good guys.

1810
01:44:32,910 --> 01:44:35,900
Jeeps fitted with concertina wire called Daley dozers.

1811
01:44:37,830 --> 01:44:39,790
When did I stop being one of the good guys?

1812
01:44:39,790 --> 01:44:42,910
Let's find out. Were glass bottles thrown at the police?

1813
01:44:42,910 --> 01:44:44,730
We want justice!

1814
01:44:45,830 --> 01:44:49,040
‎No, don't approach! Stay back! Stay…

1815
01:44:49,040 --> 01:44:52,040
Some people threw bottles. Dave was trying to shut it down.

1816
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,910
We were frustrated. All three footbridges--

1817
01:44:53,910 --> 01:44:56,790
So you, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others eluded the police.

1818
01:44:56,790 --> 01:44:59,500
I wouldn't say we eluded them. We were fleeing from them.

1819
01:44:59,500 --> 01:45:01,350
‎Found an unguarded bridge…

1820
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:07,830
Now here's where things got weird.

1821
01:45:07,830 --> 01:45:12,150
You, Abbie, Jerry and 11 others found the only way to the convention.

1822
01:45:12,500 --> 01:45:15,370
In the lobby of the Hilton, right next to the convention center,

1823
01:45:15,370 --> 01:45:17,870
is a bar called the Haymarket Tavern.

1824
01:45:17,870 --> 01:45:21,200
The Haymarket Tavern is a watering hole

1825
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,020
for Chicago's political class and their hookers.

1826
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:30,290
And the place was packed to watch Humphrey getting the nomination a mile away.

1827
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:34,450
From the House of Representatives who represents the great state of Ohio,

1828
01:45:34,450 --> 01:45:36,940
representative Wayne Hays to the stage.

1829
01:45:37,120 --> 01:45:38,580
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

1830
01:45:38,580 --> 01:45:41,330
The great state of Ohio, the Buckeye State--

1831
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:42,980
The Buckeye State!

1832
01:45:43,500 --> 01:45:47,700
One side of the Haymarket Tavern is a picture window with smoked glass.

1833
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:50,310
You can't see inside it from the street.

1834
01:45:50,870 --> 01:45:52,660
You made it through the riot police,

1835
01:45:52,660 --> 01:45:56,060
tear gas, the National Guard, you're in sight of the convention center.

1836
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:05,560
-Where we got trapped.   -What's another word for trapped?

1837
01:46:06,250 --> 01:46:08,410
We were trapped between the window and the police.

1838
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:10,150
What's another word for trapped?

1839
01:46:12,200 --> 01:46:13,650
Caught, right?

1840
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:19,950
Inside the bar, it's like the '60s never happened.

1841
01:46:19,950 --> 01:46:23,450
Outside the bar, the '60s were being performed

1842
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:25,650
for anyone who looked out of the window.

1843
01:46:26,040 --> 01:46:27,660
Anyone know what a buckeye is?

1844
01:46:27,660 --> 01:46:29,000
-Buckeye?   -Yeah.

1845
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:31,450
A buckeye is a nut. A poisonous nut.

1846
01:46:31,450 --> 01:46:33,060
Hey.

1847
01:46:33,330 --> 01:46:35,950
94 votes for Vice President Humphrey.

1848
01:46:35,950 --> 01:46:38,700
Am I the only one who sees what's going on out there?

1849
01:46:38,700 --> 01:46:42,560
And we see a cop do something you don't ever wanna see a cop do.

1850
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:53,270
'60s outside the bar, '50s inside the bar.

1851
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:57,080
And then, an unnecessary metaphor.

1852
01:46:57,080 --> 01:46:58,310
It's a nut.

1853
01:46:58,700 --> 01:47:00,520
-What?   -A nut!

1854
01:47:02,620 --> 01:47:04,200
Were you resisting arrest?

1855
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:07,450
‎-They pushed us through the window!   -You overrun the riot police…

1856
01:47:07,450 --> 01:47:09,040
Which is more than Rennie can say!

1857
01:47:09,040 --> 01:47:13,120
Over 400 people admitted to area hospitals with severe injuries!

1858
01:47:13,120 --> 01:47:18,000
They had armored vehicles and bayonets! They took off their name tags and badges!

1859
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,810
We were trying to protest peacefully at the fucking convention!

1860
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,400
Hands behind your back.

1861
01:47:39,410 --> 01:47:40,850
Yeah.

1862
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,190
Who started the riot, Tom?

1863
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:52,310
‎Our…

1864
01:47:53,200 --> 01:47:54,520
What?

1865
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:57,400
‎Our…

1866
01:47:58,500 --> 01:47:59,940
Our blood.

1867
01:48:02,540 --> 01:48:04,100
"Our blood."

1868
01:48:04,870 --> 01:48:07,190
‎"If our blood is gonna flow…"

1869
01:48:08,410 --> 01:48:10,020
You meant to say,

1870
01:48:10,540 --> 01:48:14,080
"If our blood is gonna flow, then let it flow all over the city."

1871
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:15,580
You didn't mean the cops.

1872
01:48:15,580 --> 01:48:19,520
You were saying, "If they're gonna beat us up, everyone should see it."

1873
01:48:24,540 --> 01:48:25,870
Jesus Christ!

1874
01:48:25,870 --> 01:48:26,830
‎You do this…

1875
01:48:26,830 --> 01:48:28,950
He does this, it's a pattern.

1876
01:48:28,950 --> 01:48:31,330
Read his portion of the Port Huron Statement.

1877
01:48:31,330 --> 01:48:36,650
He implies possessive pronouns and uses vague noun modifiers.

1878
01:48:38,330 --> 01:48:40,330
You read the Port Huron Statement?

1879
01:48:40,330 --> 01:48:42,400
I've read everything you've published.

1880
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:44,910
I didn't know that.

1881
01:48:44,910 --> 01:48:46,730
You're a talented guy.

1882
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,370
-Except for the possessive pronouns.   -I know.

1883
01:48:49,370 --> 01:48:51,400
And the vague noun modifiers.

1884
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:02,980
Put Abbie on the stand instead.

1885
01:49:06,200 --> 01:49:09,400
Would you state your full name for the record, please?

1886
01:49:09,580 --> 01:49:10,980
It's Abbie.

1887
01:49:11,200 --> 01:49:12,560
Last name.

1888
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:14,950
My grandfather's name was Shaboysnakoff,

1889
01:49:14,950 --> 01:49:18,120
but he was a Russian Jew protesting anti-Semitism,

1890
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:21,690
so he was assigned a name that would sound like yours.

1891
01:49:22,080 --> 01:49:23,950
What is your date of birth?

1892
01:49:23,950 --> 01:49:26,450
Psychologically, 1960.

1893
01:49:26,450 --> 01:49:29,330
What were you doing until 1960?

1894
01:49:29,330 --> 01:49:32,900
Nothing. I believe it's called an American education.

1895
01:49:33,790 --> 01:49:36,750
Why don't we just proceed with the testimony?

1896
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,000
Sure.

1897
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:41,270
Abbie, do you know why you're on trial here?

1898
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:45,440
We carried certain ideas across state lines.

1899
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:50,810
Not machine guns or drugs or little girls. Ideas.

1900
01:49:51,450 --> 01:49:55,450
When we crossed from New York to New Jersey to Pennsylvania to Ohio to Illinois,

1901
01:49:55,450 --> 01:49:57,870
we had certain ideas.

1902
01:49:57,870 --> 01:49:59,600
And for that,

1903
01:50:00,080 --> 01:50:03,450
we were gassed, beaten, arrested and put on trial.

1904
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:04,500
Okay.

1905
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:09,600
In 1861, Lincoln said in his inaugural address,

1906
01:50:09,950 --> 01:50:12,790
"When the people shall grow weary of their constitutional right

1907
01:50:12,790 --> 01:50:14,040
to amend their government,

1908
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,700
they shall exert their revolutionary right

1909
01:50:16,700 --> 01:50:21,060
to dismember and overthrow that government."

1910
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:25,200
And if Lincoln had given that speech in Lincoln Park last summer,

1911
01:50:25,200 --> 01:50:27,500
he'd be put on trial with the rest of us.

1912
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:32,350
So how do you overthrow or dismember, as you say, your government peacefully?

1913
01:50:32,830 --> 01:50:35,600
In this country, we do it every four years.

1914
01:50:37,250 --> 01:50:38,690
That's all.

1915
01:50:48,500 --> 01:50:53,480
So Chicago was just a massive voter registration drive.

1916
01:50:55,080 --> 01:50:56,310
Yeah.

1917
01:50:56,500 --> 01:50:59,160
Did you hear the tape we played of Tom Hayden?

1918
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:00,790
-Yes.   -You heard the tape?

1919
01:51:00,790 --> 01:51:03,870
Did you hear Mr. Hayden give an instruction to his people

1920
01:51:03,870 --> 01:51:05,120
to take to the streets?

1921
01:51:05,120 --> 01:51:09,410
"His people"? Hayden's not a Mafia don and neither am I.

1922
01:51:09,410 --> 01:51:10,580
Did you hear him say,

1923
01:51:10,580 --> 01:51:14,270
"If blood is gonna flow, let it flow all over the city"?

1924
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:17,690
‎The beginning of that sentence was supposed to be…

1925
01:51:18,790 --> 01:51:20,650
Yes. Yes, I did.

1926
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:23,020
What'd you think of that?

1927
01:51:25,620 --> 01:51:29,350
I think Tom Hayden is a badass of an American patriot.

1928
01:51:30,790 --> 01:51:35,020
I didn't ask what you thought of the man, I asked of his instruction of the crowd.

1929
01:51:35,370 --> 01:51:38,370
I've also heard Tom Hayden say, "Let's end the war,"

1930
01:51:38,370 --> 01:51:40,650
but nobody stopped shooting.

1931
01:51:40,910 --> 01:51:45,040
You can do anything to anything by taking it out of context, Mr. Schultz.

1932
01:51:45,040 --> 01:51:49,310
"If blood is gonna flow"? How do you take that out of context?

1933
01:51:49,950 --> 01:51:55,000
A guy once said, "I am come to set a man at variance with his father

1934
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:58,650
and the daughter against her mother." You know who said it?

1935
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:00,440
Jerry Rubin.

1936
01:52:00,700 --> 01:52:02,100
Yes.

1937
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:03,730
No.

1938
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:05,410
It was Jesus Christ.

1939
01:52:05,410 --> 01:52:07,500
Matthew 10:35.

1940
01:52:07,500 --> 01:52:11,400
And it sure sounds like he's telling kids to kill their parents.

1941
01:52:11,750 --> 01:52:15,480
Until you read Matthew 10:34 and 10:36.

1942
01:52:15,950 --> 01:52:16,870
Do you have--

1943
01:52:16,870 --> 01:52:20,190
He'd just seen his best friend get hit in the head with a nightstick.

1944
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:24,100
The police, Mr. Schultz, whose people are they?

1945
01:52:24,290 --> 01:52:27,080
-Do you have contempt for your government?   -Do I--

1946
01:52:27,080 --> 01:52:30,810
Yeah, do you have contempt for your government?

1947
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,790
I think the institutions of our democracy are wonderful things

1948
01:52:35,790 --> 01:52:38,870
that right now are populated by some terrible people.

1949
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:40,810
Please answer the question.

1950
01:52:41,120 --> 01:52:42,650
Tell me again?

1951
01:52:48,910 --> 01:52:51,020
Do you have contempt for your government?

1952
01:52:51,250 --> 01:52:54,950
I'll tell you, it's nothing compared to the contempt my government has for me.

1953
01:52:54,950 --> 01:52:58,910
We've heard testimony from 27 witnesses, under oath,

1954
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:02,830
that say you hoped for a confrontation with the police,

1955
01:53:02,830 --> 01:53:06,250
that your plans for the convention were designed specifically

1956
01:53:06,250 --> 01:53:08,750
to draw the police into a confrontation.

1957
01:53:08,750 --> 01:53:11,580
If I'd known it was gonna be the first wish of mine that came true,

1958
01:53:11,580 --> 01:53:12,950
I would've aimed higher.

1959
01:53:12,950 --> 01:53:15,080
It's a yes or no question. When you came to Chicago,

1960
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,980
were you hoping for a confrontation with the police?

1961
01:53:29,830 --> 01:53:31,940
I'm concerned you have to think about it.

1962
01:53:32,450 --> 01:53:34,520
Give me a moment, would you, friend?

1963
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:37,770
I've never been on trial for my thoughts before.

1964
01:54:23,450 --> 01:54:25,060
All rise.

1965
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,830
69 CR 180,

1966
01:54:28,830 --> 01:54:32,560
United States of America v. David Dellinger et al.

1967
01:54:42,870 --> 01:54:46,540
The law requires that before sentencing,

1968
01:54:46,540 --> 01:54:51,540
I allow the defendant or defendants to make a statement to the court.

1969
01:54:51,540 --> 01:54:56,540
I've advised defense counsel that the court will allow one defendant

1970
01:54:56,540 --> 01:54:59,870
to speak for the group, and I've been advised

1971
01:54:59,870 --> 01:55:01,870
the group has chosen Mr. Hayden.

1972
01:55:01,870 --> 01:55:04,690
-Is that right?   -Yes, sir.

1973
01:55:04,790 --> 01:55:09,270
Mr. Hayden, in spite of your actions during the convention,

1974
01:55:09,580 --> 01:55:13,520
you are the one defendant who has shown, during this trial,

1975
01:55:13,790 --> 01:55:17,950
respect for this court and for this country,

1976
01:55:17,950 --> 01:55:20,500
and remorse for those actions.

1977
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:23,690
‎I truly believe… And I mean this.

1978
01:55:24,620 --> 01:55:31,190
I truly believe that one day you will be a very productive part of our system.

1979
01:55:31,660 --> 01:55:37,310
I'd like you to make your statement brief and without political content of any kind.

1980
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,700
If you make your statement brief,

1981
01:55:39,700 --> 01:55:44,770
if you make it respectful, if you make it remorseful and to the point,

1982
01:55:45,200 --> 01:55:49,560
I will look favorably upon that when administering my sentence.

1983
01:55:51,290 --> 01:55:53,600
Do you understand what I've just said?

1984
01:55:55,290 --> 01:55:58,520
-Mr. Hayden?   -Yes, sir.

1985
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:02,350
-You'll look favorably in sentencing.   -Yes.

1986
01:56:03,660 --> 01:56:07,160
If I make my statement respectful and remorseful.

1987
01:56:07,160 --> 01:56:08,400
Yes.

1988
01:56:11,580 --> 01:56:14,230
I'm sorry, Your Honor, what was the third one?

1989
01:56:14,450 --> 01:56:15,770
Brief.

1990
01:56:15,950 --> 01:56:17,230
Brief.

1991
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:23,040
If I do these things, my government will look favorably on me.

1992
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:24,650
You understand?

1993
01:56:25,250 --> 01:56:26,480
Yes, sir.

1994
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:29,560
Please begin.

1995
01:56:30,790 --> 01:56:32,150
Okay.

1996
01:56:33,700 --> 01:56:36,850
Your Honor, since this trial began,

1997
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:42,810
4,752 US troops have been killed in Vietnam.

1998
01:56:45,120 --> 01:56:48,560
‎And the following… are their names.

1999
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:54,850
"Private First Class Dennis Walter Kipp, 18 years old."

2000
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:58,540
"Private Eric Alan Bosch, 21 years old."

2001
01:56:58,540 --> 01:56:59,620
Mr. Kunstler!

2002
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:03,040
"Lance Corporal Robert Earl Ellis, 19 years old."

2003
01:57:03,040 --> 01:57:09,200
Mr. Kunstler! He will not read 5,000 names for the record!

2004
01:57:09,200 --> 01:57:12,450
"Robert Ford, 21 years old."

2005
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:13,540
There will be order!

2006
01:57:13,540 --> 01:57:16,810
"Staff Sergeant David Cruz Chavez, 31 years old."

2007
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,160
"Lance Corporal Douglas W. Jackson, 19 years old."

2008
01:57:21,160 --> 01:57:22,810
There will be order!

2009
01:57:22,950 --> 01:57:27,330
"Private First Class William Melvin Johnson, 20 years old."

2010
01:57:27,330 --> 01:57:28,660
There will be order!

2011
01:57:28,660 --> 01:57:31,200
‎-"Lance Corporal Robert Ryan Hammond…"   -There will be order!

2012
01:57:31,200 --> 01:57:32,370
"19 years old."

2013
01:57:32,370 --> 01:57:35,580
"Corporal Philip Lawrence Jewell, 20 years old."

2014
01:57:35,580 --> 01:57:40,950
-He will not read 4,500 names!   -"Sergeant Brian John Morrow, 19 years."

2015
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:45,540
"Master Sergeant James Warren Finsel, 36 years old."

2016
01:57:45,540 --> 01:57:47,040
